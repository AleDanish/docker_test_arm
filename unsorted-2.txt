INFERNO I

Introduction to the Divine Comedy

The Wood and the Mountain

    When half way through the journey of our life
    I found that I was in a gloomy wood,
    because the path which led aright was lost.
    And ah, how hard it is to say just what
    this wild and rough and stubborn woodland was,
    the very thought of which renews my fear!
    So bitter ’t is, that death is little worse;
    but of the good to treat which there I found,
    I ’ll speak of what I else discovered there.

    I cannot well say how I entered it,
    so full of slumber was I at the moment
    when I forsook the pathway of the truth;
    but after I had reached a mountain’s foot,
    where that vale ended which had pierced my heart
    with fear, I looked on high,
    and saw its shoulders
    mantled already with that planet’s rays
    which leadeth one aright o’er every path.

    Then quieted a little was the fear,
    which in the lake-depths of my heart had lasted
    throughout the night I passed so piteously.

    And even as he who, from the deep emerged
    with sorely troubled breath upon the shore,
    turns round, and gazes at the dangerous water;
    even so my mind, which still was fleeing on,
    turned back to look again upon the pass
    which ne’er permitted any one to live.

    When I had somewhat eased my weary body,
    o’er the lone slope I so resumed my way,
    that e’er the lower was my steady foot.
    Then lo, not far from where the ascent began,
    a Leopard which, exceeding light and swift,
    was covered over with a spotted hide,
    and from my presence did not move away;
    nay, rather, she so hindered my advance,
    that more than once I turned me to go back.

    Some time had now from early morn elapsed,
    and with those very stars the sun was rising
    that in his escort were, when Love Divine
    in the beginning moved those beauteous things;
    I therefore had as cause for hoping well
    of that wild beast with gaily mottled skin,
    the hour of daytime and the year’s sweet season;
    but not so, that I should not fear the sight,
    which next appeared before me, of a Lion,
    — against me this one seemed to be advancing
    with head erect and with such raging hunger,
    that even the air seemed terrified thereby —

    and of a she-Wolf, which with every lust
    seemed in her leanness laden, and had caused
    many ere now to lead unhappy lives.
    The latter so oppressed me with the fear
    that issued from her aspect, that I lost
    the hope I had of winning to the top.

    And such as he is, who is glad to gain,
    and who, when times arrive that make him lose,
    weeps and is saddened in his every thought;
    such did that peaceless animal make me,
    which, ’gainst me coming, pushed me, step by step,
    back to the place where silent is the sun.

    While toward the lowland I was falling fast,
    the sight of one was offered to mine eyes,
    who seemed, through long continued silence, weak.
    When him in that vast wilderness I saw,
    “Have pity on me,” I cried out to him,
    “whate’er thou be, or shade, or very man!”

    “Not man,” he answered, “I was once a man;
    and both my parents were of Lombardy,
    and Mantuans with respect to fatherland.
    ’Neath Julius was I born, though somewhat late,
    and under good Augustus’ rule I lived
    in Rome, in days of false and lying gods.
    I was a poet, and of that just man,
    Anchises’ son, I sang, who came from Troy
    after proud Ilion had been consumed.

[[9]]

    But thou, to such sore trouble why return?
    Why climbst thou not the Mountain of Delight,
    which is of every joy the source and cause?”

    “Art thou that Virgil, then, that fountain-head
    which poureth forth so broad a stream of speech?”
    I answered him with shame upon my brow.
    “O light and glory of the other poets,
    let the long study, and the ardent love
    which made me con thy book, avail me now.
    Thou art my teacher and authority;
    thou only art the one from whom I took
    the lovely manner which hath done me honor.
    Behold the beast on whose account I turned;
    from her protect me, O thou famous Sage,
    for she makes both my veins and pulses tremble!”

    “A different course from this must thou pursue,”
    he answered, when he saw me shedding tears,
    “if from this wilderness thou wouldst escape;
    for this wild beast, on whose account thou criest,
    alloweth none to pass along her way,
    but hinders him so greatly, that she kills;
    and is by nature so malign and guilty,
    that never doth she sate her greedy lust,
    but after food is hungrier than before.
    Many are the animals with which she mates,
    and still more will there be, until the Hound
    shall come, and bring her to a painful death.

    He shall not feed on either land or wealth,
    but wisdom, love and power shall be his food,
    and ’tween two Feltros shall his birth take place.
    Of that low Italy he ’ll be the savior,
    for which the maid Camilla died of wounds,
    with Turnus, Nisus and Eurỳalus.
    And he shall drive her out of every town,
    till he have put her back again in Hell,
    from which the earliest envy sent her forth.

    I therefore think and judge it best for thee
    to follow me; and I shall be thy guide,
    and lead thee hence through an eternal place,
    where thou shalt hear the shrieks of hopelessness
    of those tormented spirits of old times,
    each one of whom bewails the second death;
    then those shalt thou behold who, though in fire,
    contented are, because they hope to come,
    whene’er it be, unto the blessèd folk;
    to whom, thereafter, if thou wouldst ascend,
    there ’ll be for that a worthier soul than I.
    With her at my departure I shall leave thee,
    because the Emperor who rules up there,
    since I was not obedient to His law,
    wills none shall come into His town through me.
    He rules as emperor everywhere, and there
    as king; there is His town and lofty throne.
    O happy he whom He thereto elects!”

    And I to him: “O Poet, I beseech thee,
    even by the God it was not thine to know,
    so may I from this ill and worse escape,
    conduct me thither where thou saidst just now,
    that I may see Saint Peter’s Gate, and those
    whom thou describest as so whelmed with woe.”

    He then moved on, and I behind him kept.

INFERNO II

Introduction to the Inferno

The Mission of Virgil

    Daylight was going, and the dusky air
    was now releasing from their weary toil
    all living things on earth; and I alone
    was making ready to sustain the war
    both of the road and of the sympathy,
    which my unerring memory will relate.

    O Muses, O high Genius, help me now!
    O Memory, that wrotest what I saw,
    herewith shall thy nobility appear!

    I then began: “Consider, Poet, thou
    that guidest me, if strong my virtue be,
    or e’er thou trust me to the arduous course.
    Thou sayest that the sire of Silvio entered,
    when still corruptible, the immortal world,
    and that while in his body he was there.
    Hence, that to him the Opponent of all ill
    was courteous, considering the great result
    that was to come from him, both who, and what,
    seems not unfitting to a thoughtful man;
    for he of fostering Rome and of her sway
    in the Empyrean Heaven was chosen as sire;

    and both of these, if one would tell the truth,
    were foreordained unto the holy place,
    where greatest Peter’s follower hath his seat.
    While on this quest, for which thou giv’st him praise,
    he heard the things which of his victory
    the causes were, and of the Papal Robe.
    The Chosen Vessel went there afterward,
    to bring thence confirmation in the faith,
    through which one enters on salvation’s path.
    But why should I go there, or who concedes it?
    I ’m not Aeneas, nor yet Paul am I;
    me worthy of this, nor I nor others deem.
    If, therefore, I consent to come, I fear
    lest foolish be my coming; thou art wise,
    and canst much better judge than I can talk.”

    And such as he who unwills what he willed,
    and changes so his purpose through new thoughts,
    that what he had begun he wholly leaves;
    such on that gloomy slope did I become;
    for, as I thought it over, I gave up
    the enterprise so hastily commenced.

    “If I have rightly understood thy words,”
    replied the shade of that Great-hearted man,
    “thy soul is hurt by shameful cowardice,
    which many times so sorely hinders one,
    that from an honored enterprise it turns him,
    as seeing falsely doth a shying beast.

    In order that thou rid thee of this fear,
    I ’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
    the first time I was grieved on thy account.
    Among the intermediate souls I was,
    when me a Lady called, so beautiful
    and happy, that I begged her to command.
    Her eyes were shining brighter than a star,
    when sweetly and softly she began to say,
    as with an angel’s voice she spoke to me:

    ‘O courteous Mantuan spirit, thou whose fame
    is still enduring in the world above,
    and will endure as long as lasts the world,
    a friend of mine, but not a friend of Fortune,
    is on his journey o’er the lonely slope
    obstructed so, that he hath turned through fear;
    and, from what I have heard of him in Heaven,
    I fear lest he may now have strayed so far,
    that I have risen too late to give him help.
    Bestir thee, then, and with thy finished speech,
    and with whatever his escape may need,
    assist him so that I may be consoled.
    I, who now have thee go, am Beatrice;
    thence come I, whither I would fain return;
    ’t was love that moved me, love that makes me speak.
    When in the presence of my Lord again,
    often shall I commend thee unto Him.’
    Thereat she ceased to speak, and I began:

    ‘O Lady of virtue, thou through whom alone
    the human race excels all things contained
    within the heaven that hath the smallest circles,
    thy bidding pleases me so much, that late
    I ’d be, hadst thou already been obeyed;
    thou needst but to disclose to me thy will.
    But tell me why thou dost not mind descending
    into this center from that ample place,
    whither thou art so eager to return.’

    ‘Since thou wouldst know thereof so inwardly,
    I ’ll tell thee briefly,’ she replied to me,
    ‘why I am not afraid to enter here.
    Of those things only should one be afraid,
    that have the power of doing injury;
    not of the rest, for they should not be feared.
    I, of His mercy, am so made by God,
    that me your wretchedness doth not affect,
    nor any flame of yonder fire molest.
    There is a Gentle Lady up in Heaven,
    who grieves so at this check, whereto I send thee,
    that broken is stern judgment there above.
    She called Lucìa in her prayer, and said:
    ‘Now hath thy faithful servant need of thee,
    and I, too, recommend him to thy care.’
    Lucìa, hostile to all cruelty,
    set forth thereat, and came unto the place,
    where I with ancient Rachel had my seat.

    ‘Why, Beatrice,’ she said, ‘true Praise of God,
    dost thou not succour him who loved thee so,
    that for thy sake he left the common herd?
    Dost thou not hear the anguish of his cry?
    see’st not the death that fights him on the flood,
    o’er which the sea availeth not to boast?
    Ne’er were there any in the world so swift
    to seek their profit and avoid their loss,
    as I, after such words as these were uttered,
    descended hither from my blessèd seat,
    confiding in that noble speech of thine,
    which honors thee and whosoe’er has heard it.’

    Then, after she had spoken to me thus,
    weeping she turned her shining eyes away;
    which made me hasten all the more to come;
    and, even as she wished, I came to thee,
    and led thee from the presence of the beast,
    which robbed thee of the fair Mount’s short approach.
    What is it, then? Why, why dost thou hold back?
    Why dost thou lodge such baseness in thy heart,
    and wherefore free and daring art thou not,
    since three so blessèd Ladies care for thee
    within the court of Heaven, and my words, too,
    give thee the promise of so much that’s good?”

    As little flowers by the chill of night
    bowed down and closed, when brightened by the sun,
    stand all erect and open on their stems;

    so likewise with my wearied strength did I;
    and such good daring coursed into my heart,
    that I began as one who had been freed:

    “O piteous she who hastened to my help,
    and courteous thou, that didst at once obey
    the words of truth that she addressed to thee!
    Thou hast with such desire disposed my heart
    toward going on, by reason of thy words,
    that to my first intention I ’ve returned.
    Go on now, since we two have but one will;
    thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Teacher thou!”

    I thus addressed him; then, when he had moved,
    I entered on the wild and arduous course.

INFERNO III

The Gate and Vestibule of Hell

Cowards and Neutrals. Acheron

    Through me one goes into the town of woe,
    through me one goes into eternal pain,
    through me among the people that are lost.

    Justice inspired my high exalted Maker;
    I was created by the Might divine,
    the highest Wisdom and the primal Love.

    Before me there was naught created, save
    eternal things, and I eternal last;
    all hope abandon, ye that enter here!

    These words of gloomy color I beheld
    inscribed upon the summit of a gate;
    whence I: “Their meaning, Teacher, troubles me.”

    And he to me, like one aware, replied:
    “All fearfulness must here be left behind;
    all forms of cowardice must here be dead.
    We ’ve reached the place where, as I said to thee,
    thou ’lt see the sad folk who have lost the Good
    which is the object of the intellect.”
    Then, after he had placed his hand in mine
    with cheerful face, whence I was comforted,
    he led me in among the hidden things.

    There sighs and wails and piercing cries of woe
    reverberated through the starless air;
    hence I, at first, shed tears of sympathy.
    Strange languages, and frightful forms of speech,
    words caused by pain, accents of anger, voices
    both loud and faint, and smiting hands withal,
    a mighty tumult made, which sweeps around
    forever in that timelessly dark air,
    as sand is wont, whene’er a whirlwind blows.

    And I, whose head was girt about with horror,
    said: “Teacher, what is this I hear? What folk
    is this, that seems so overwhelmed with woe?”

    And he to me: “This wretched kind of life
    the miserable spirits lead of those
    who lived with neither infamy nor praise.
    Commingled are they with that worthless choir
    of Angels who did not rebel, nor yet
    were true to God, but sided with themselves.
    The heavens, in order not to be less fair,
    expelled them; nor doth nether Hell receive them,
    because the bad would get some glory thence.”

    And I: “What is it, Teacher, grieves them so,
    it causes them so loudly to lament?”

    “I ’ll tell thee very briefly,” he replied.
    “These have no hope of death, and so low down
    is this unseeing life of theirs, that envious
    they are of every other destiny.

    The world allows no fame of them to live;
    Mercy and Justice hold them in contempt.
    Let us not talk of them; but look, and pass!”

    And I, who gazed intently, saw a flag,
    which, whirling, moved so swiftly that to me
    contemptuous it appeared of all repose;
    and after it there came so long a line
    of people, that I never would have thought
    that death so great a number had undone.

    When some I ’d recognized, I saw and knew
    the shade of him who through his cowardice
    the great Refusal made. I understood
    immediately, and was assured that this
    the band of cowards was, who both to God
    displeasing are, and to His enemies.
    These wretched souls, who never were alive,
    were naked, and were sorely spurred to action
    by means of wasps and hornets that were there.
    The latter streaked their faces with their blood,
    which, after it had mingled with their tears,
    was at their feet sucked up by loathsome worms.

    When I had given myself to peering further,
    people I saw upon a great stream’s bank;
    I therefore said: “Now, Teacher, grant to me
    that I may know who these are, and what law
    makes them appear so eager to cross over,
    as in this dim light I perceive they are.”

    And he to me: “These things will be made clear
    to thee, as soon as on the dismal strand
    of Acheron we shall have stayed our steps.”
    Thereat, with shame-suffused and downcast eyes,
    and fearing lest my talking might annoy him,
    up to the river I abstained from speech.

    Behold then, coming toward us in a boat,
    an agèd man, all white with ancient hair,
    who shouted: “Woe to you, ye souls depraved!
    Give up all hope of ever seeing Heaven!
    I come to take you to the other shore,
    into eternal darkness, heat and cold.
    And thou that yonder art, a living soul,
    withdraw thee from those fellows that are dead.”
    But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
    he said: “By other roads and other ferries
    shalt thou attain a shore to pass across,
    not here; a lighter boat must carry thee.”

    To him my Leader: “Charon, be not vexed;
    thus is it yonder willed, where there is power
    to do whate’er is willed; so ask no more!”

    Thereat were quieted the woolly cheeks
    of that old boatman of the murky swamp,
    who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
    Those spirits, though, who nude and weary were,
    their color changed, and gnashed their teeth together,
    as soon as they had heard the cruel words.

    They kept blaspheming God, and their own parents,
    the human species, and the place, and time,
    and seed of their conception and their birth.
    Then each and all of them drew on together,
    weeping aloud, to that accursèd shore
    which waits for every man that fears not God.

    Charon, the demon, with his ember eyes
    makes beckoning signs to them, collects them all,
    and with his oar beats whoso takes his ease.

    Even as in autumn leaves detach themselves,
    now one and now another, till their branch
    sees all its stripped off clothing on the ground;
    so, one by one, the evil seed of Adam
    cast themselves down that river-bank at signals,
    as doth a bird to its recalling lure.
    Thus o’er the dusky waves they wend their way;
    and ere they land upon the other side,
    another crowd collects again on this.

    “My son,” the courteous Teacher said to me,
    “all those that perish in the wrath of God
    from every country come together here;
    and eager are to pass across the stream,
    because Justice Divine so spurs them on,
    that what was fear is turned into desire.
    A good soul never goes across from hence;
    if Charon, therefore, findeth fault with thee,
    well canst thou now know what his words imply.”

    The darkling plain, when this was ended, quaked
    so greatly, that the memory of my terror
    bathes me even now with sweat.
    The tear-stained ground
    gave forth a wind, whence flashed vermilion light
    which in me overcame all consciousness;
    and down I fell like one whom sleep o’ertakes.

INFERNO IV

The First Circle. The Borderland

Unbaptized Worthies. Illustrious Pagans

    A heavy thunder-clap broke the deep sleep
    within my head, so that I roused myself,
    as would a person who is waked by force;
    and standing up erect, my rested eyes
    I moved around, and with a steady gaze
    I looked about to know where I might be.

    Truth is I found myself upon the verge
    of pain’s abysmal valley, which collects
    the thunder-roll of everlasting woes.
    So dark it was, so deep and full of mist,
    that, howsoe’er I gazed into its depths,
    nothing at all did I discern therein.

    “Into this blind world let us now descend!”
    the Poet, who was death-like pale, began,
    “I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”

    And I, who of his color was aware,
    said: “How am I to come, if thou take fright,
    who ’rt wont to be my comfort when afraid?”

    “The anguish of the people here below,”
    he said to me, “brings out upon my face
    the sympathy which thou dost take for fear.

    Since our long journey drives us, let us go!”
    Thus he set forth, and thus he had me enter
    the first of circles girding the abyss.

    Therein, as far as one could judge by list’ning,
    there was no lamentation, saving sighs
    which caused a trembling in the eternal air;
    and this came from the grief devoid of torture
    felt by the throngs, which many were and great,
    of infants and of women and of men.

    To me then my good Teacher: “Dost not ask
    what spirits these are whom thou seest here?
    Now I would have thee know, ere thou go further,
    that these sinned not; and though they merits have,
    ’t is not enough, for they did not have baptism,
    the gateway of the creed believed by thee;
    and if before Christianity they lived,
    they did not with due worship honor God;
    and one of such as these am I myself.
    For such defects, and for no other guilt,
    we ’re lost, and only hurt to this extent,
    that, in desire, we live deprived of hope.”

    Great sorrow filled my heart on hearing this,
    because I knew of people of great worth,
    who in that Borderland suspended were.

    “Tell me, my Teacher, tell me, thou my Lord,”
    I then began, through wishing to be sure
    about the faith which conquers every error;

    “came any ever, by his own deserts,
    or by another’s, hence, who then was blest?”

    And he, who understood my covert speech,
    replied: “To this condition I was come
    but newly, when I saw a Mighty One
    come here, crowned with the sign of victory.
    From hence He drew the earliest parent’s shade,
    and that of his son, Abel, that of Noah,
    and Moses the law-giver and obedient;
    Abram the patriarch, and David king,
    Israel, with both his father and his sons,
    and Rachel, too, for whom he did so much,
    and many others; and He made them blest;
    and I would have thee know that, earlier
    than these, there were no human spirits saved.”

    Because he talked we ceased not moving on,
    but all the while were passing through the wood,
    the wood, I mean, of thickly crowded shades.
    Nor far this side of where I fell asleep
    had we yet gone, when I beheld a fire,
    which overcame a hemisphere of gloom.
    Somewhat away from it we were as yet,
    but not so far, but I could dimly see
    that honorable people held that place.

    “O thou that honorest both art and science,
    who are these people that such honor have,
    that it divides them from the others’ life?”

    And he to me: “The honorable fame,
    which speaks of them in thy live world above,
    in Heaven wins grace, which thus advances them.”

    And hereupon a voice was heard by me:
    “Do honor to the loftiest of poets!
    his shade, which had departed, now returns.”
    And when the voice had ceased and was at rest,
    four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
    their looks were neither sorrowful nor glad.

    My kindly Teacher then began to say:
    “Look at the one who comes with sword in hand
    before the three, as if their lord he were.
    Homer he is, the sovreign poet; Horace,
    the satirist, the one that cometh next;
    the third is Ovid, Lucan is the last.
    Since each of them in common shares with me
    the title which the voice of one proclaimed,
    they do me honor, and therein do well.”

    Thus gathered I beheld the fair assembly
    of those the masters of the loftiest song,
    which soareth like an eagle o’er the rest.

    Then, having talked among themselves awhile,
    they turned around to me with signs of greeting;
    and, when he noticed this, my Teacher smiled.
    And even greater honor still they did me,
    for one of their own company they made me,
    so that amid such wisdom I was sixth.

    Thus on we went as far as to the light,
    talking of things whereof is silence here
    becoming, even as speech was, where we spoke.

    We reached a noble Castle’s foot, seven times
    encircled by high walls, and all around
    defended by a lovely little stream.
    This last we crossed as if dry land it were;
    through seven gates with these sages I went in,
    and to a meadow of fresh grass we came.
    There people were with slow and serious eyes,
    and, in their looks, of great authority;
    they spoke but seldom and with gentle voice.
    We therefore to one side of it drew back
    into an open place so luminous
    and high, that each and all could be perceived.
    There on the green enamel opposite
    were shown to me the spirits of the great,
    for seeing whom I glory in myself.

    I saw Electra with companions many,
    of whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
    and Caesar armed, with shining falcon eyes.
    I saw Camilla with Penthesilea
    upon the other side, and King Latinus,
    who with Lavinia, his own daughter, sat.
    I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin out,
    Lucretia, Julia, Martia and Cornelia,
    and, all alone, I saw the Saladin.

    Then, having raised my brows a little higher,
    the Teacher I beheld of those that know,
    seated amid a philosophic group.
    They all look up to him, all honor him;
    there Socrates and Plato I beheld,
    who nearer than the rest are at his side;
    Democritus, who thinks the world chance-born,
    Diogenes, Anaxagoras and Thales,
    Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno;
    of qualities I saw the good collector,
    Dioscorides I mean; Orpheus I saw,
    Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca;
    Euclid, the geometer, and Ptolemy,
    Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen,
    Averrhoès, who made the famous comment.

    I cannot speak of all of them in full,
    because my long theme drives me on so fast,
    that oft my words fall short of what I did.

    The sixfold band now dwindles down to two;
    my wise Guide leads me by a different path
    out of the calm into the trembling air;
    and to a place I come, where naught gives light.

INFERNO V

The Second Circle. Sexual Intemperance

The Lascivious and Adulterers

    Thus from the first of circles I went down
    into the second, which surrounds less space,
    and all the greater pain, which goads to wailing.

    There Minos stands in horrid guise, and snarls;
    inside the entrance he examines sins,
    judges, and, as he girds himself, commits.
    I mean that when an ill-born soul appears
    before him, it confesses itself wholly;
    and thereupon that Connoisseur of sins
    perceives what place in Hell belongs to it,
    and girds him with his tail as many times,
    as are the grades he wishes it sent down.
    Before him there are always many standing;
    they go to judgment, each one in his turn;
    they speak and hear, and then are downward hurled.

    “O thou that comest to the inn of woe,”
    said Minos, giving up, on seeing me,
    the execution of so great a charge,
    “see how thou enter, and in whom thou put
    thy trust; let not the gate-way’s width deceive thee!”

    To him my Leader: “Why dost thou, too, cry?

    Hinder thou not his fate-ordained advance;
    thus is it yonder willed, where there is power
    to do whate’er is willed; so ask no more!”

    And now the woeful sounds of actual pain
    begin to break upon mine ears; I now
    am come to where much wailing smiteth me.
    I reached a region silent of all light,
    which bellows as the sea doth in a storm,
    if lashed and beaten by opposing winds.
    The infernal hurricane, which never stops,
    carries the spirits onward with its sweep,
    and, as it whirls and smites them, gives them pain.
    Whene’er they come before the shattered rock,
    there lamentations, moans and shrieks are heard;
    there, cursing, they blaspheme the Power Divine.
    I understood that to this kind of pain
    are doomed those carnal sinners, who subject
    their reason to their sensual appetite.

    And as their wings bear starlings on their way,
    when days are cold, in full and wide-spread flocks;
    so doth that blast the evil spirits bear;
    this way and that, and up and down it leads them;
    nor only doth no hope of rest, but none
    of lesser suffering, ever comfort them.

    And even as cranes move on and sing their lays,
    forming the while a long line in the air;
    thus saw I coming, uttering cries of pain,

    shades borne along upon the aforesaid storm;
    I therefore said: “Who, Teacher, are the people
    the gloomy air so cruelly chastises?”

    “The first of those of whom thou wouldst have news,”
    the latter thereupon said unto me,
    “was empress over lands of many tongues.
    To sexual vice so wholly was she given,
    that lust she rendered lawful in her laws,
    thus to remove the blame she had incurred.
    Semiramis she is, of whom one reads
    that she gave suck to Ninus, and became
    his wife; she held the land the Soldan rules.

    The next is she who killed herself through love,
    and to Sichaeus’ ashes broke her faith;
    the lustful Cleopatra follows her.
    See Helen, for whose sake so long a time
    of guilt rolled by, and great Achilles see,
    who fought with love when at the end of life.
    Paris and Tristan see;” and then he showed me,
    and pointed out by name, a thousand shades
    and more, whom love had from our life cut off.

    When I had heard my Leader speak the names
    of ladies and their knights of olden times,
    pity o’ercame me, and I almost swooned.
    “Poet,” I then began, “I ’d gladly talk
    with those two yonder who together go,
    and seem to be so light upon the wind.”

    “Thou ’lt see thy chance when nearer us they are;”
    said he, “beseech them then by that same love
    which leadeth them along, and they will come.”

    Soon as the wind toward us had bent their course.
    I cried: “O toil-worn souls, come speak with us,
    so be it that One Else forbid it not!”

    As doves, when called by their desire, come flying
    with raised and steady pinions through the air
    to their sweet nest, borne on by their own will;
    so from the band where Dido is they issued,
    advancing through the noisome air toward us,
    so strong with love the tone of my appeal.

    “O thou benign and gracious living creature,
    that goest through the gloomy purple air
    to visit us, who stained the world blood-red;
    if friendly were the universal King,
    for thy peace would we pray to Him, since pity
    thou showest for this wretched woe of ours.
    Of whatsoever it may please you hear
    and speak, we will both hear and speak with you,
    while yet, as now it is, the wind is hushed.
    The town where I was born sits on the shore,
    whither the Po descends to be at peace
    together with the streams that follow him.
    Love, which soon seizes on a well-born heart,
    seized him for that fair body’s sake, whereof
    I was deprived; and still the way offends me.

    Love, which absolves from loving none that ’s loved,
    seized me so strongly for his love of me,
    that, as thou see’st, it doth not leave me yet.
    Love to a death in common led us on;
    Cain’s ice awaiteth him who quenched our life.”
    These words were wafted down to us from them.

    When I had heard those sorely troubled souls,
    I bowed my head, and long I held it low,
    until the Poet said: “What thinkest thou?”
    When I made answer I began: “Alas!
    how many tender thoughts and what desire
    induced these souls to take the woeful step!”

    I then turned back to them again and spoke,
    and I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,
    cause me to weep with grief and sympathy.
    But tell me: at the time of tender sighs,
    whereby and how did Love concede to you
    that ye should know each other’s veiled desires?”

    And she to me: “There is no greater pain
    than to remember happy days in days
    of misery; and this thy Leader knows.
    But if to know the first root of our love
    so yearning a desire possesses thee,
    I ’ll do as one who weepeth while he speaks.
    One day, for pastime merely, we were reading
    of Launcelot, and how love o’erpowered him;
    alone we were, and free from all misgiving.

    Oft did that reading cause our eyes to meet,
    and often take the color from our faces;
    and yet one passage only overcame us.
    When we had read of how the longed-for smile
    was kissed by such a lover, this one here,
    who nevermore shall be divided from me,
    trembling all over, kissed me on my mouth.
    A Gallehault the book, and he who wrote it!
    No further in it did we read that day.”

    While one was saying this, the other spirit
    so sorely wept, that out of sympathy
    I swooned away as though about to die,
    and fell as falls a body that is dead.

INFERNO VI

The Third Circle. Intemperance in Food

Gluttons

    On my return to consciousness, which closed
    before the kindred couple’s piteous case,
    which utterly confounded me with grief,
    new torments all around me I behold,
    and new tormented ones, where’er I move,
    where’er I turn, and wheresoe’er I gaze.

    In the third circle am I, that of rain
    eternal, cursèd, cold and burdensome;
    its measure and quality are never new.
    Coarse hail, and snow, and dirty-colored water
    through the dark air are ever pouring down;
    and foully smells the ground receiving them.

    A wild beast, Cerberus, uncouth and cruel,
    is barking with three throats, as would a dog,
    over the people that are there submerged.
    Red eyes he hath, a dark and greasy beard,
    a belly big, and talons on his hands;
    he claws the spirits, flays and quarters them.
    The rainfall causes them to howl like dogs;
    with one side they make shelter for the other;
    oft do the poor profaners turn about.

    When Cerberus, the mighty worm, perceived us,
    his mouths he opened, showing us his fangs;
    nor had he any limb that he kept still.
    My Leader then stretched out his opened palms,
    and took some earth, and with his fists well filled,
    he threw it down into the greedy throats.
    And like a dog that, barking, yearns for food,
    and, when he comes to bite it, is appeased,
    since only to devour it doth he strain
    and fight; even such became those filthy faces
    of demon Cerberus, who, thundering, stuns
    the spirits so, that they would fain be deaf.

    Over the shades the heavy rain beats down
    we then were passing, as our feet we set
    upon their unreal bodies which seem real.
    They each and all were lying on the ground,
    excepting one, which rose and sat upright,
    when it perceived us pass in front of it.

    “O thou that through this Hell art being led,”
    it said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;
    for thou, before I unmade was, wast made.”

    And I to it: “The anguish thou art in
    perchance withdraws thee from my memory so,
    it doth not seem that thee I ever saw.
    But tell me who thou art, that in so painful
    a place art set, and to such punishment,
    that none, though greater, so repulsive is.”

    And he to me: “Thy town, which is so full
    of envy that the bag o’erflows already,
    owned me when I was in the peaceful life.
    Ciacco, you townsmen used to call me then;
    for my injurious fault of gluttony
    I ’m broken, as thou seest, by the rain;
    nor yet am I, sad soul, the only one,
    for all these here are subject, for like fault,
    unto like pain.” Thereat he spoke no more.

    “Thy trouble, Ciacco,” I replied to him,
    “so burdens me that it invites my tears;
    but tell me, if thou canst, to what will come
    the citizens of our divided town;
    if any one therein is just; and tell me
    the reason why such discord hath assailed her.”

    And he to me then: “After struggling long
    they ’ll come to bloodshed, and the boorish party
    will drive the other out with much offence.
    Then, afterward, the latter needs must fall
    within three suns, and the other party rise,
    by help of one who now is ‘on the fence.’
    A long time will it hold its forehead up,
    keeping the other under grievous weights,
    howe’er it weep therefor, and be ashamed.
    Two men are just, but are not heeded there;
    the three sparks that have set men’s hearts on fire,
    are overweening pride, envy and greed.”

    Herewith he closed his tear-inspiring speech.
    And I to him: “I ’d have thee teach me still,
    and grant the favor of some further talk.
    Farinàta and Tegghiàio, who so worthy were,
    Jàcopo Rusticùcci, Arrigo and Mosca,
    and the others who were set on doing good,
    tell me where these are, and let me know of them;
    for great desire constraineth me to learn
    if Heaven now sweeten, or Hell poison them.”

    And he: “Among the blackest souls are these;
    a different fault weighs toward the bottom each;
    if thou descend so far, thou mayst behold them.
    But when in the sweet world thou art again,
    recall me, prithee, unto others’ minds;
    I tell no more, nor further answer thee.”

    His fixed eyes thereupon he turned askance;
    a while he looked at me, then bowed his head,
    and fell therewith among the other blind.

    Then said my Leader: “He ’ll not wake again
    on this side of the angel-trumpet’s sound.
    What time the hostile Podestà shall come,
    each soul will find again its dismal tomb,
    each will take on again its flesh and shape,
    and hear what through eternity resounds.”

    We thus passed through with slowly moving steps
    the filthy mixture of the shades and rain,
    talking a little of the future life;

    because of which I said: “These torments, Teacher,
    after the Final Sentence will they grow,
    or less become, or burn the same as now.”

    And he to me: “Return thou to thy science,
    which holdeth that the more a thing is perfect,
    so much the more it feels of weal or woe.
    Although this cursèd folk shall nevermore
    arrive at true perfection, it expects
    to be more perfect after, than before.”

    As in a circle, round that road we went,
    speaking at greater length than I repeat,
    and came unto a place where one descends;
    there found we Plutus, the great enemy.

INFERNO VII

The Fourth Circle. Intemperance in Wealth

Misers and Prodigals. The Fifth Circle

    “Papè Satàn, papè Satàn, alèppë!”
    thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
    that noble Sage, then, who knew everything,
    said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear
    distress thee, for, whatever power he have,
    he ’ll not prevent our going down this rock.”

    Then to those swollen lips he turned around,
    and said: “Be silent, thou accursèd wolf;
    with thine own rage consume thyself within!
    Not causeless is our going to the bottom;
    there is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
    vengeance upon the arrogant rebellion.”

    As sails, when swollen by the wind, fall down
    entangled, when the mast breaks; even so,
    down to the ground the cruel monster fell.

    Into the fourth ditch we descended thus,
    advancing further o’er the woeful edge,
    which bags all evil in the universe.

    Justice of God, alas! who heapeth up
    the many unheard of toils and pains I saw,
    and wherefore doth our sin torment us so?

    As yonder o’er Charybdis doth the sea,
    which breaks against the one it runs to meet,
    so must the people dance a ring-dance here.
    I here saw folk, more numerous than elsewhere,
    on one side and the other, with great howls
    rolling big weights around by strength of chest;
    they struck against each other; then, right there
    each turned, and rolling back his weight, cried out:
    “Why keepest thou?” and “Wherefore throw away?”
    They circled thus around the gloomy ring
    on either hand unto the point opposed,
    still shouting each to each their vile refrain;
    then each turned back, when through his own half-ring
    he had attained the other butting place.

    And I, whose heart was well nigh broken, said:
    “Now, Teacher, show me who these people are,
    and tell me whether all these tonsured ones
    upon our left ecclesiastics were.”

    And he replied to me: “They each and all
    were in their first life so squint-eyed in mind,
    that they with measure used no money there.
    Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
    whene’er they reach the two points of the ring,
    where difference in fault unmateth them.
    These churchmen were, who have no hairy covering
    upon their heads, and Popes and Cardinals,
    among whom avarice works its mastery.”

    And I to him: “Among such men as these
    I surely, Teacher, ought to recognize
    a few, who by these sins polluted were.”

    And he to me: “Thou shapest a vain thought;
    the undiscerning life which made them foul,
    now to all recognition makes them dark.
    To these two shocks they ’ll come eternally;
    these from the sepulchre will rise again
    close-fisted; these, shorn of their very hair.
    Ill-giving and ill-keeping took from them
    the lovely world, and set them at this fray;
    to qualify it I ’ll not use fair words.
    Now canst thou, son, behold the short-lived cheat
    of riches that are put in Fortune’s care,
    and for whose sake the human race contends;
    for, all the gold there is beneath the moon,
    and all that was there once, could not avail
    to make one of these weary spirits rest.”

    “Teacher,” said I to him, “now tell me further:
    what is this Fortune thou dost touch upon,
    which hath the world’s good things thus in her claws?”

    “O foolish creatures,” said he then to me.
    “how great the ignorance which hurteth you!
    I ’d have thee swallow now my thought of her.
    The One whose knowledge everything transcends,
    so made the heavens, and so gave guides to them,
    that every part on every other shines,

    thus equally distributing the light;
    likewise for worldly splendours He ordained
    a general minister and guide, to change,
    from time to time, the vain goods of the world
    from race to race, from one blood to another,
    past all resistance by the minds of men;
    wherefore, one people governs, and the other
    declines in power, according to her judgment,
    which hidden is, as in the grass a snake.
    Your knowledge is not able to resist her;
    foreseeing, she decides, and carries on
    her government, as theirs the other gods.
    Her permutations have no truce at all;
    necessity compels her to be swift;
    hence oft it happens that a change occurs.
    This is the one who is so often cursed
    even by those who ought to give her praise,
    yet give her blame amiss, and ill repute.
    But she is blest, and gives no heed to that;
    among the other primal creatures glad,
    she turns her sphere, and blest enjoys herself.
    But now to woe more piteous let ’s descend;
    now falls each star that rose when I set out,
    and one is here forbidden too long a stay.”

    We crossed the circle to the other bank
    over a bubbling stream, that poureth down
    along a ditch which from it takes its shape.

    Than purple-black much darker was its water;
    and we, accompanying its dusky waves,
    went down and entered on an uncouth path.
    A swamp it forms which hath the name of Styx,
    this dismal little brook, when it hath reached
    the bottom of the grey, malignant slopes.

    And I, who was intensely gazing there,
    saw muddy people in that slimy marsh,
    all naked, and with anger in their looks.
    They struck each other, not with hands alone,
    but with their heads and chests, and with their feet,
    and rent each other piecemeal with their teeth.

    Said the good Teacher: “Son, thou seest now
    the souls of those whom anger overcame;
    nay, more, I ’d have thee certainly believe
    that ’neath the water there are folk who sigh,
    and make this water bubble at its surface,
    as, wheresoe’er it turn, thine eye reveals.
    Stuck in the slime, they say: “Sullen we were
    in the sweet air that ’s gladdened by the sun,
    bearing within us fumes of surliness;
    we now are sullen in the swamp’s black mire.”
    This hymn they gurgle down inside their throats,
    because they cannot utter it with perfect speech.

    And so we circled round the filthy fen
    a great arc ’tween the dry bank and the marsh,
    our eyes intent on those that swallow mud;
    and to a tower’s foot we came at last.

INFERNO VIII

The Fifth Circle. Intemperance in Indignation

The Wrathful and Sullen. Styx. The City of Dis

    I say, continuing, that long before
    we ever reached the lofty tower’s foot,
    our eyes had upward toward its summit turned,
    because of two small flames we there saw placed,
    and of another answering from so far,
    that hardly could mine eyesight make it out.
    Then to all wisdom’s Sea I turned around,
    and said: “What sayeth this? and what replies
    that other fire? and who are they that made it?”

    And he to me: “Upon the filthy waves
    thou canst already see what is expected,
    unless the marsh’s fog conceal it from thee.”

    Bowstring ne’er shot an arrow from itself,
    that sped away so swiftly through the air,
    as I beheld a slender little boat
    come toward us through the water thereupon,
    under the guidance of a single boatman,
    who shouted: “Thou art caught now, wicked soul!”

    “O Phlegyas, Phlegyas,” said my Master then,
    “this time thou criest out in vain! No longer
    shalt thou have us, than while we cross the swamp.”

    Like one who listens to a great deceit
    practiced upon him, and who then resents it,
    so Phlegyas in his stifled wrath became.
    My Leader then went down into the boat,
    and had me enter after him; and only
    when I was in it did it laden seem.
    Soon as my Leader and I were in the boat,
    the ancient prow goes on its way, and cuts
    more water than with others is its wont.

    While we were speeding through the stagnant trench,
    one stood before me filled with mud, and said:
    “Now who art thou, that comest ere thy time?”

    And I to him: “Even though I come, I stay not;
    but who art thou, that art become so foul?”
    He answered: “As thou see’st, I ’m one who weeps.”

    Then I to him: “In sorrow and in grief
    mayst thou, accursèd spirit, here remain,
    for thee I know, all filthy though thou be!”

    Then toward the boat he stretched out both his hands;
    my wary Teacher, therefore, thrust him off,
    saying: “Away there with the other dogs!”
    And with his arms he then embraced my neck,
    and kissed my face, and said: “Blessèd be she
    who pregnant was with thee, indignant soul!
    He was a haughty person in the world;
    nor is there any goodness which adorns
    his memory; hence his shade is furious here.

    How many now up yonder think themselves
    great kings, who here shall be like pigs in mire,
    leaving behind them horrible contempt!”

    And I said: “Teacher, I ’d be greatly pleased
    to see him get a ducking in this broth,
    before we issue from the marshy lake.”

    And he to me: “Thou shalt be satisfied
    before the shore reveal itself to thee;
    ’t is meet that thou enjoy a wish like that.”

    Soon after this I saw the muddy people
    making such havoc of him, that therefor
    I still give praise and render thanks to God.
    They all were shouting: “At Filippo Argenti!”
    the spirit of the wrathful Florentine
    turning, meanwhile, his teeth against himself.

    We left him there; of him I therefore tell
    no more; but on mine ears there smote a wail,
    hence I, intent ahead, unbar mine eyes.
    The kindly Teacher said: “Now, son, at last
    the town, whose name is Dis, is drawing near
    with all its host of burdened citizens.”

    And I said: “Teacher, clearly I behold
    its mosques already in that valley there,
    vermilion, as if issuing out of fire.”

    And he to me: “The eternal fire within
    which keeps them burning, maketh them look red,
    as thou perceivest in this nether Hell.”

    Thereat we came inside the trenches deep,
    which fortify that region comfortless;
    to me its walls appeared to be of iron.
    Not without going first a long way round,
    we came to where the boatman cried aloud
    to us: “Get out, for here the entrance is!”

    More than a thousand o’er the gates I saw
    of those that from the heavens had rained, who, vexed,
    were saying: “Who is he, that, without death,
    is going through the kingdom of the dead?”
    And my wise Teacher thereupon made signs
    of wishing to have private talk with them.

    Their great disdain they somewhat checked, and said:
    “Come thou alone, and let him go his way,
    who with such daring entered this domain.
    Let him retrace alone his foolish road,
    and try it, if he can; for thou shalt here
    remain, that him so dark a land didst show.”

    Think, Reader, whether I lost heart on hearing
    those cursèd words; for I did not believe
    that I should e’er return on earth again.

    “O my dear Leader, who hast made me safe
    more than seven times, and extricated me
    from serious dangers which I had to face,
    forsake me not,” said I, “when so undone!
    If further progress be denied to us,
    let us at once retrace our steps together.”

    That Lord then, who had brought me thither, said:
    “Be not afraid; for none can take from us
    our passage, since by such an One ’t is given!
    But thou, await me here, and with good hope
    nourish and comfort thou thy weary soul,
    for I ’ll not leave thee in the nether world.”

    Thus goes his way, and there abandons me,
    my tender Father, and I in doubt remain;
    for Yes and No contend within my head.

    I could not hear what he proposed to them;
    but with them there he did not long remain,
    for each in rivalry ran back within.
    They closed the gates, those enemies of ours,
    right in my Master’s face, who stayed outside,
    and walking with slow steps returned to me.
    His eyes were downcast, and his eyebrows shorn
    of all self-trust, and as he sighed he said:
    “Who has forbidden me the homes of pain?”

    “Though I get angry, be not thou dismayed,”
    he said to me, “for I shall win the fight,
    whate’er defensive stir be made within.
    This insolence of theirs is nothing new,
    for at a gateway less concealed than this
    they used it once, which still is lockless found.
    Death’s scroll thou sawest over it; and now
    this side of it One such descends the slope,
    crossing the rings unguided, that through him
    the city will be opened unto us.”

INFERNO IX

The Gate of the City of Dis

The Sixth Circle. Heresy

    The color cowardice brought out on me,
    who saw my Leader coming back, the sooner
    repressed in him his unaccustomed hue.
    He stopped attentive like a man who listens;
    because his eyesight could not lead him far
    through the dark air, and through the heavy fog.
    “Yet we must win the battle,” he began,
    “unless . . . One such did offer us herself!
    Oh, how I long for some one to arrive!”

    I well perceived how, when he overlaid
    what he began to say by what came after,
    that these were words that differed from the first.
    But none the less his language gave me fear,
    because I lent to his unfinished phrase
    a meaning worse, perhaps, than he intended.

    “Into this bottom of the dismal shell
    doth any of that first grade e’er descend,
    whose only penalty is hope cut off?”

    I asked this question. He replied to me:
    “It seldom comes to pass that one of us
    performs the journey whereupon I go.

    ’T is true that I was conjured once before
    down here by magic of that wild Erìchtho,
    who used to call shades back into their bodies.
    My flesh had hardly been made bare of me,
    when me she forced to enter yonder wall,
    and thence withdraw a soul from Judas’ ring.
    That is the lowest and the darkest place,
    and from the heaven that turns all things most distant;
    well do I know the road; so be at rest!
    This marsh, from which the mighty stench exhales,
    girdles the woeful city round about,
    which without wrath we cannot enter now.”

    And more he said, but I recall it not,
    because mine eye had made me wholly heed
    the glowing summit of the lofty tower,
    where three infernal Furies stained with blood
    had suddenly uprisen all at once,
    having the members and the mien of women,
    and girt with water-snakes of brightest green;
    for hair they had small serpents and horned snakes,
    wherewith their frightful temples were entwined.

    And he, who well the handmaids of the Queen
    of everlasting lamentation knew,
    said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erìnyes!
    This is Megaera here upon the left;
    Alecto, she who weepeth on the right;
    Tisìphonë’s between.” Thereat he ceased.

    Each with her nails was tearing at her breast;
    they smote them with their hands, and cried so loud,
    that to the Poet I drew close in dread.
    “Now let Medusa come! We ’ll turn him thus
    to stone!” they all cried out, as down they looked;
    “wrong were we not to punish Theseus’ raid.”

    “Turn back, and close thine eyes, for should the Gorgon
    reveal itself, and thou behold the face,
    there ’d be no more returning up above.”
    The Teacher thus: and turning me himself,
    on my hands he did not so far rely,
    as not to close mine eyes with his as well.

    O ye in whom intelligence is sound,
    heed carefully the teaching which lies hidden
    beneath the veil of my mysterious lines!

    There now was coming o’er the turbid waves
    the uproar of a dread-inspiring sound,
    because of which both shores were all aquake,
    a noise like nothing other than a wind,
    impetuous through opposing heats, which smites
    a forest, and without the least restraint
    shatters, lays low, and carries off its boughs;
    dust-laden it goes proudly on its way,
    and makes wild animals and shepherds flee.

    He freed mine eyes, and said: “Direct thou now
    thy keenest vision o’er that ancient scum,
    to where that reeking smoke is most intense.”

    As frogs before the hostile water-snake
    scatter in all directions through the water,
    till each is squatting huddled on the shore;
    more than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
    who thus from one were fleeing, who on foot,
    but with dry feet, was passing over Styx.
    That dense air he kept moving from his face
    by often passing his left hand before him,
    and only with that trouble weary seemed.
    I well perceived he was a Messenger
    from Heaven, and to my Teacher turned; with signs
    he warned me to keep still, and bow before him.
    Ah, how disdainful did he seem to me!
    He reached the gate, and with a little wand
    he opened it, for hindrance had he none.

    “O people thrust from Heaven and held in scorn,”
    upon the horrid threshold he began,
    “whence dwells in you this overweening pride?
    Why is it that ye kick against the Will,
    from which its end can never be cut off,
    and which hath more than once increased your pain?
    Of what avail to butt against the Fates?
    Your Cerberus, if ye remember well,
    still sports for this a hairless chin and neck.”

    He then returned along the filthy road,
    nor did he say a word to us; but looked
    like one whom other cares constrain and gnaw,

    than that of him who in his presence is;
    then we with full assurance toward the town,
    after those holy words, addressed our steps.

    We entered it without the least contention;
    and I, who longed to look about and see
    the state of those whom such a fortress holds,
    when I was in it, cast mine eyes around,
    and see on every side an ample plain,
    with anguish and with awful torture filled.

    Even as at Arles, where marshy turns the Rhone,
    or as at Pola near Quarnaro’s gulf,
    which bounds Italia, and her border bathes,
    the sepulchres make all the ground uneven;
    so likewise did they here on every side,
    save that their nature was more bitter here;
    for flames were spread about within the tombs,
    whereby they glowed with such intensity,
    that no art needeth greater heat for iron.
    The lids of all of them were raised, and wails
    so woeful issued thence, that of a truth
    they seemed the wails of wretched, tortured men.

    “Teacher, what sort of people are those there,”
    said I, “who, buried in those arc-like tombs,
    make themselves heard by means of woeful sighs?”

    “Arch-heretics are with their followers here”
    said he, “of every sect, and far more laden
    than thou believest are the sepulchers.

    Here like with like is buried, and more hot
    and less so are the monuments.” Thereat,
    when he had turned him to the right, we passed
    between the woes and lofty bastioned walls.

INFERNO X

    Now wends his way along a narrow path,
    between the torments and the city’s wall,
    my Teacher and, behind his shoulders, I.

    “O lofty Virtue,” I began, “that leadst me
    around the impious circles at thy pleasure,
    converse with me and satisfy my wishes.
    The people that are lying in the tombs,
    could they be seen? For all the lids are raised,
    it seems, and there is no one keeping guard.”

    And he to me: “They all will be locked in,
    when from Jehoshaphat they here return
    together with the bodies they have left
    above. On this side have their burial-place
    with Epicurus all his followers,
    who claim that with the body dies the soul.
    To the request, however, which thou makest
    thou ’lt soon receive a due reply in here,
    as also to the wish thou keepest from me.”

    And I: “Good Leader, I but keep my heart
    concealed from thee, in order to speak little;
    nor hast thou only now thereto disposed me.”

    “O Tuscan, thou that through the town of fire
    dost go alive with such respectful speech,
    in this place be thou pleased to stay thy steps.
    Thy very language makes thee manifest
    a native of that noble fatherland,
    to which I was, perhaps, too great a bane.”

    All of a sudden issued forth these words
    from one of those ark-tombs; hence I, in fear,
    a little closer to my Leader drew.
    And he said: “Turn around; what doest thou?
    See Farinata who has risen there;
    thou ’lt see him wholly from his girdle up.”

    Already had I fixed mine eyes on his;
    and he was standing up with chest and head
    erect, as if he had great scorn for Hell.
    My Leader then with bold and ready hands
    pushed me between the sepulchers toward him,
    saying: “Now let thy words be frank and clear.”

    When I was ’neath his tomb, he looked at me
    awhile, and then, as though disdainfully,
    he asked of me: “Who were thine ancestors?”

    And I, who was desirous to obey,
    hid it not from him, but revealed it all;
    whereat he slightly raised his brows, and said:
    “So bitterly were they opposed to me,
    and to mine ancestors, and to my party,
    that I on two occasions scattered them.”

    “If they were driven out,” I answered him,
    “from all directions they returned both times;
    your people, though, have not well learned that art.”

    A shade then at the tomb’s uncovered mouth
    rose at his side as far up as his chin;
    I think that he had risen upon his knees.
    Round me he looked, as if he wished to see
    whether some other one were with me there;
    but when his doubt had wholly spent itself,
    weeping he said: “If thou through this blind prison
    dost go by reason of highmindedness,
    where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”

    And I to him: “I come not by myself;
    he who is waiting yonder leads me here,
    one whom, perhaps, your Guido held in scorn.”
    The nature of his torment and his words
    had read this person’s name to me already;
    on this account was my reply so full.

    Then of a sudden standing up, he cried:
    “What saidst thou? Held? Is he not still alive?
    Doth not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”
    When he perceived the short delay I made
    before replying, down upon his back
    he fell, nor outside showed himself again.

    The other one, meanwhile, the great-souled man,
    at whose request I stopped, changed not his looks,
    nor did he move his neck or turn his side.

    And “If,” continuing his previous words,
    he said: “if they have badly learned that art,
    far more doth that torment me than this bed.
    And yet that Lady’s face who ruleth here
    shall not be lighted fifty times again,
    ere thou shalt know how heavy that art is.
    And so mayst thou return to the sweet world,
    pray tell me why so pitiless toward mine
    that people is in every law of theirs?”

    Whence I to him: “The havoc and great slaughter
    which caused the Arbia to be colored red,
    occasion such petitions in our church.”

    When, sighing, he had tossed his head, he said:
    “In this thing I was not alone, nor surely
    had I, without due cause, moved with the rest;
    but I was yonder, where assent was given
    by every one to do away with Florence,
    the only one to openly defend her.”

    “So may your seed eventually repose,”
    I begged of him, “untie for me, I pray,
    the knot which has perplexed my thinking here.
    It seems, if well I hear, that ye behold
    beforehand that which time brings with itself,
    while in the present ye do otherwise.”

    “We see,” he said, “like one whose sight is poor,
    things that are far from us; to that extent
    the Highest Leader shines upon us still.

    When they approach, or are, our intellect
    is wholly vain, and we, if others bring
    no news, know nothing of your human state.
    Hence thou canst understand that wholly dead
    will be our knowledge from that moment on,
    when closed shall be the gateway of the future.”

    Thereat, for I was grieved at my mistake,
    I said: “You ’ll therefore tell that fallen man
    his son is dwelling with the living still;
    and if in answering I was mute just now,
    cause him to know it was because my thoughts
    were struggling with the problem you have solved.”

    And now my Teacher was recalling me;
    with greater haste I therefore begged the spirit
    that he would tell me who was with him there.

    He said: “With o’er a thousand here I lie;
    the second Frederick and the Cardinal
    are here within; I speak not of the rest.”

    He thereupon concealed himself; and I,
    those words recalling which seemed hostile to me,
    back toward the ancient Poet turned my steps.
    The latter moved; and then, as on we went,
    he said to me: “Why art thou so perplexed?”
    And him in what he asked I satisfied.

    “Then let thy mind preserve,” that Sage enjoined,
    “what thou hast heard against thyself; pay now
    attention here!” His finger then he raised.

    “When in the sweet ray’s presence thou shalt be
    of Her whose lovely eyes see everything,
    from her thou ’lt know the journey of thy life.”

    Thereafter to the left he turned his feet;
    we left the wall, and toward the middle went
    along a path which to a valley leads,
    which even up there unpleasant made its stench.

INFERNO XI

The Sixth Circle. Heresy

The Distribution of the Damned in the Inferno

    Upon the utmost verge of a high bank,
    formed in a circle by great broken rocks,
    we came upon a still more cruel pack;
    and there, by reason of the horrible
    excess of stench the deep abyss exhales,
    for shelter we withdrew behind the lid
    of a large tomb, whereon I saw a scroll
    which said: “Pope Anastasius I contain,
    whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”

    “Our going down from here must be delayed,
    so that our sense may first get used a little
    to this foul blast; we shall not mind it then.”

    The Teacher thus; and I: “Find thou therefor
    some compensation, lest our time be lost.”
    And he to me: “See how I think of this.”

    “My son, within these rocks,” he then began,
    “are three small circles which, from grade to grade,
    are similar to those thou leavest now.
    Full of accursèd spirits are they all;
    but that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
    hear how, and wherefore they are packed together.

    Of all wrong-doing which in Heaven wins hate
    injustice is the end, and each such end
    aggrieves by either violence or fraud.
    But whereas fraud is man’s peculiar evil,
    God hates it most; therefore the fraudulent
    are down below, and greater pain assails them.

    All the first circle holds the violent;
    but since against three persons force is used,
    its shape divides it into three great rings.
    Both against God, one’s neighbor, and one ’s self
    may force be used; against themselves, I mean,
    and what is theirs, as clearly shown thou ’lt hear.
    By force both death and painful wounds are given
    one ’s neighbor, and thereby his property
    is ruined, burned, and by extortions robbed;
    the first ring, hence, torments in separate troops
    all homicides and those that smite with malice,
    spoilers of property and highway robbers.
    Upon oneself may one lay violent hands,
    and on one ’s goods; hence in the second ring
    must needs repentant be without avail
    whoever of your world deprives himself,
    gambles away and dissipates his means,
    and weepeth there where he should joyful be.
    ’Gainst God may force be used, by wittingly
    denying that He is, by blasphemy,
    and by disprizing Nature and His Goodness;

    and therefore with its mark the lesser ring
    sealeth both Sodom and Cahors, and him
    who, speaking from his heart, despises God.

    And fraud, whereby all consciences are bitten,
    one may employ against a man who trusts him,
    and ’gainst a man who storeth up no trust.
    This latter kind of fraud would seem to kill
    only the bond of love which Nature makes;
    hence in the second circle make their nest
    hypocrisy, and flatteries, and workers
    of magic, coining, theft and simony,
    panders and grafters, and such filth as these.

    In the other way forgotten is the love
    which Nature makes, and that which afterward
    is joined thereto, whence special trust is born;
    hence in the smallest ring, where the universe
    its center hath, and on which Dis is seated,
    whoe’er betrays is spent eternally.”

    “Teacher,” said I, “thine argument proceeds
    most lucidly, and full well classifies
    this deep abyss and those that people it.
    But tell me now: those of the muddy marsh,
    those whom the wind drives, those the rain beats down,
    and those that with such keen tongues meet each other,
    why are n’t they punished in the red-hot town,
    if God be angry with them? and, if not,
    why are they tortured in those several ways?”

    And he to me: “Why doth thine intellect
    wander so far from that which is its wont,
    or doth thy mind intently gaze elsewhere?
    Hast thou no recollection of the words
    with which thine Ethics treats extensively
    the dispositions three which Heaven rejects,
    Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
    Bestiality, and how Incontinence
    offends God least, and hence receives least blame?
    If thou consider this opinion well,
    and then remember who those are above,
    that outside undergo their punishment,
    well shalt thou see why from these wretches here
    they ’re set apart, and why less wrathfully
    Vengeance Divine is hammering on them there.”

    “O Sun that healest every troubled sight,
    thou so contentest me when answering questions,
    that doubt, no less than knowledge, pleases me.
    Return a little further back,” said I,
    “to where thou sayest usury offends
    Goodness Divine, and loose the tangled knot.”

    “Philosophy” said he to me, “points out
    to him that understandeth it, and not
    in one part only, that Nature takes her course
    from the Intellect Divine, and from its Art;
    and if thou note thy Physics carefully,
    after not many pages shalt thou find

    that your art follows that, as best it can,
    as the disciple him who teaches; hence,
    your art is grandchild, as it were, to God.
    From these two things, if thou recall to mind
    the first of Genesis, must people needs
    obtain their livelihood, and progress make.
    And as the usurer takes another course,
    Nature both in herself and in her follower
    he scorneth, since in something else he trusts.

    But follow me now, for I please to go;
    because the Fishes o’er the horizon quiver,
    and wholly over Caurus lies the Wain,
    and one descends the bank much further on.”

INFERNO XII

    The place, where to descend the bank we came,
    was Alp-like, and, through what was also there,
    such that all eyes would be repelled by it.

    As is that downfall on the hither side
    of Trent, which sidewise smote the Àdige,
    through earthquake or through failure of support;
    since from the mountain’s summit, whence it moved
    down to the plain, the rock is shattered so,
    that it would yield a path for one above;
    even such was the descent of that ravine;
    and on the border of the broken bank
    was stretched at length the Infamy of Crete,
    who in the seeming heifer was conceived;
    and when he saw us there he bit himself,
    like one whom inward anger overcomes.

    In his direction then my Sage cried out:
    “Dost thou, perhaps, think Athens’ duke is here,
    who gave thee death when in the world above?
    Begone, thou beast! for this man cometh not
    taught by thy sister, but is going by,
    in order to behold your punishments.”

    As doth a bull, who from his leash breaks free
    the moment he receives the mortal blow,
    and cannot walk, but plunges here and there;
    so doing I beheld the Minotaur;
    and he, aware, cried out: “Run to the pass!
    ’t is well that, while he rages, thou descend.”

    Thereat we made our way adown that heap
    of fallen rocks, which often ’neath my feet
    were moved, because of their unwonted load.

    I went along in thought; and he: “Perchance
    thou thinkest of this landslide, which is guarded
    by that beast’s anger which I quenched just now.
    Now I would have thee know that, when down here
    to nether Hell I came, that other time,
    this mass of rock had not yet fallen down.
    But certainly, if I remember well,
    not long ere He arrived, who carried off
    from Dis the highest circle’s mighty prey,
    on every side the deep and foul abyss
    so trembled that I thought the universe
    had felt the love, whereby, as some believe,
    the world to Chaos hath been oft reduced;
    and at that moment this old mass of rock
    was thus, both here and elsewhere, overthrown.
    But turn thine eyes down yonder now; for lo,
    the stream of blood is drawing near to us,
    wherein boils who by violence harms others.”

    O blind cupidity, O foolish wrath,
    that so dost in our short life goad us on,
    and after, in the eternal, steep us thus!

    I saw a wide moat curving in an arc,
    and such that it embraces all the plain,
    according as my Escort had informed me;
    and in a file, between it and the bank,
    Centaurs were running by, with arrows armed,
    as in the world it was their wont to hunt.
    On seeing us descend, they all stopped short,
    and three of them detached them from the troop,
    with bows and arrows they had chosen first.

    And one cried from afar: “Ye that descend
    the slope, to what pain are ye coming?
    Tell it from there, or else I draw my bow.”

    My Teacher said: “Our answer will we give
    to Chiron yonder, when we reach his side;
    thus ever to thy harm was thy will rash.”

    He touched me then, and said: “That one is Nessus,
    who died for lovely Dejanira’s sake,
    and who himself wrought vengeance for himself;
    the middle one, who gazes at his breast,
    is that great Chiron who brought up Achilles;
    the other, Pholus, who so wrathful was.
    They go by thousands round about the moat,
    shooting each soul that from the blood emerges
    further than its own sin allotted it.”

    To those swift-footed beasts we then drew near;
    Chiron an arrow took, and with its notch
    backward upon his jaws he pushed his beard.
    When he had thus uncovered his great mouth,
    he said unto his mates: “Are ye aware
    that he who comes behind moves what he touches?
    Yet dead men’s feet are not thus wont to do.”

    And my good Leader, who now reached his breast,
    where the two natures are together joined,
    replied: “He lives indeed, and thus alone
    must I needs show to him the dark abyss;
    necessity is leading him, not pleasure.
    One who withdrew from singing praise to God,
    gave me this new commission; he is not
    a highwayman, nor I a robber’s soul.
    But by the Power, through whom I move my steps
    along so wild a road, bestow on us
    one of thy troop, at whose side we may be,
    and who may show us where one fords, and carry
    this man upon his back, for he is not
    a spirit who can travel through the air.”

    Upon his right breast Chiron turned, and said
    to Nessus: “Turn around, and guide them thus,
    and if another troop should meet you, cause it
    to stand aside.” Then we with this safe escort
    skirted the edge of that red, boiling stream,
    wherein the boiled were crying out aloud.

    I saw some people in it to their brows.
    “These tyrants are,” the mighty Centaur said,
    “who took to bloodshed and to plundering.
    Here tears are shed because of heartless wrongs;
    here Alexander is, and who for years
    grieved Sicily, fierce Dionysius.
    The brow which hath so black a head of hair,
    is Azzolino; the other which is blond,
    Obizzo of Este, who in truth was quenched
    up in the world by his un-natural son.”
    I turned then toward the Poet, but he said:
    “Be he now first to thee, and second I.”

    A little further on the Centaur stopped
    over some people who, it seemed, emerged
    out of that boiling river from their necks.
    On one side there a lonely shade he showed us,
    and said: “He yonder in God’s bosom pierced
    the heart, which still is honored on the Thames.”

    Then people I beheld who from the stream
    held out their heads, and even all their chest;
    and many did I recognize of these.
    Thus shallower and shallower became
    that blood, until it only cooked their feet;
    here was the place for us to ford the ditch.

    “Even as thou seest that the boiling stream
    grows shallow more and more on this side here,”
    the Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe

    that on this other side its bottom sinks
    increasingly, until it joins the place
    where it behooveth tyranny to groan.
    Justice Divine is over here tormenting
    that Attila who was a scourge on earth,
    Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and forever milks
    the tears, which with the boiling it unlocks,
    from Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
    who on the highroads waged so great a war.”

    He then turned back, and crossed the ford again.

    Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
    when we had set our steps within a wood,
    which was not marked by any path whatever.
    No green leaves there, but leaves of gloomy hue;
    no smooth and straight, but gnarled and twisted, twigs;
    nor was there any fruit, but poison-thorns.
    No thickets rough and dense as these are owned
    by those wild beasts, that hate the tilled estates
    that lie between the Cécina and Corneto.

    Herein those ugly Harpies make their nest,
    who drove the Trojans from the Strophades,
    with gloomy prophecies of future loss.
    Wide wings they have, and human necks and faces;
    their feet are clawed, and feathered their great bellies;
    they utter wailings on the uncouth trees.

    My kindly Teacher then began to say:
    “Before thou enter any further, know
    that in the second ring thou art, and wilt be,
    until thou reach the horrid plain of sand;
    hence look around thee well, and things thou ’lt see,
    that from my words would take away belief.”

    Moans I heard uttered upon every side,
    but saw no person who might make them there;
    hence, utterly confused, I checked my steps.
    I think he thought I thought that all those voices
    were uttered from among those thorny trunks
    by people hiding there on our account.
    The Teacher therefore said: “If thou break off
    a little twig from any of these trees,
    the thoughts thou hast will all be proven false.”

    I then stretched out my hand a little way,
    and from a sturdy thorn-tree plucked a twig,
    whereat its trunk cried out: “Why dost thou rend me?”
    Then, after growing dark with blood, its cry
    began again: “Why dost thou break me off?
    Hast thou no spirit of compassion in thee?
    Men were we once, and now are stocks become;
    thy hand ought surely to have had more pity,
    even if the souls of serpents we had been.”

    As from a fresh, green log, that at one end
    is being burned, and at the other drips
    and makes a hissing with the escaping air;
    so from the broken twig together issued
    both words and blood; I therefore dropped the end,
    and stood dumbfounded, like a man who fears.

    “Had he before been able to believe,
    O wounded soul,” replied my Sage to him,
    “what in my verses only he has seen,

    he had not set his hand on thee; whereas
    the thing’s incredibility has made me
    lead him to do what I myself regret.
    But tell him who thou wast, that he, by way
    of compensation, may refresh thy fame
    up in the world, where he can still return.”

    The trunk: “With sweet words thou dost so entice me,
    that I can not keep still; be not annoyed,
    if I am tempted to a little talk.
    I am the man who once held both the keys
    of Frederick’s heart, and he who turned them round
    so gently, locking and unlocking it,
    that most men from his secrets I withheld;
    so faithful was I to my glorious charge,
    that for its sake I lost both sleep and strength.
    The courtesan who never turned away
    her harlot eyes from Caesar’s dwelling-place,
    a common form of death and vice of courts,
    ’gainst me inflamed the minds of every one;
    and those on fire inflamed Augustus so,
    that my glad honors turned to wretched grief.
    My mind, to vent its feelings of disdain,
    and thinking to avoid disdain by death,
    made me unjust against myself, the just.
    By this tree’s uncouth roots, I swear to you,
    I never broke the faith I owed my lord,
    who so deserving was of reverence!

    And to the world should one of you return,
    let him assist my memory, which still
    lies crushed beneath the blow which envy gave it!”

    A while he waited, then the Poet said:
    “Since he is still, lose not thy chance; but speak,
    and ask him other questions, if thou like.”

    Whence I to him: “Ask thou again whate’er
    thou thinkest satisfactory to me;
    for I could not, such pity stirs my heart!”

    Hence he began again: “So may this man
    do freely for thee what thy words request,
    imprisoned spirit, may it please thee still
    to tell us how within these knotted trunks
    a soul is bound; and tell us, if thou canst,
    if any from such limbs is ever freed.”

    Thereat the trunk blew hard, and afterward
    that wind was changed into the following words:
    “Briefly shall a reply be made to you.
    Whenever a wild spirit leaves the body,
    from which itself hath torn itself away,
    Minos commits it to the seventh ravine.
    Into the wood it falls, nor is a place
    allotted to it; but where Fortune hurls it,
    there, like a grain of spelt, it germinates.
    It grows into a sapling and wild tree;
    the Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
    cause pain to it, and for the pain a vent.

    Like other spirits, for our spoils we ’ll come,
    though not that any be reclothed therewith;
    for ’t is not right to have what one casts off.
    We ’ll drag them with us here, and then our bodies
    will all around the dismal wood be hung,
    each on the thorn-tree of its hostile shade.”

    We still were giving heed unto the trunk,
    believing that it wished to tell us more,
    when we were startled by a sudden noise,
    as likewise he is, who perceives a boar
    and pack of hounds approach his hunting-post,
    and hears the crashing of the beasts and boughs.

    And lo, two on the left, who naked were
    and scratched, and fled away so rapidly,
    they shattered all the branches of the wood.
    The one ahead: “Now hurry, hurry, death!”
    and the other one, who thought himself too slow,
    cried: “Lano, not so knowing were thy legs,
    when running from Del Toppo’s battle-jousts!”
    And then, perhaps because of failing breath,
    he there made of himself and of a bush
    a group. The wood behind these two was full
    of swarthy bitches, ravenous and fleet
    as greyhounds are, when from their chains unleashed.
    Into the one who crouched they set their teeth,
    and tore him into pieces bit by bit;
    they then made off with those his suffering limbs.

    Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
    and led me to the bush, which all in vain
    out of its bleeding rents was shedding tears.
    “O Giàcomo” it said, “da Sant’Andrea,
    what boots it thee to make a screen of me?
    and how am I to blame for thy bad life?”

    When over him my Teacher stopped, he said:
    “Who then wast thou, that through so many gashes
    art blowing forth with blood such painful speech?”

    And he to us: “O spirits that have come
    in time to see the unbecoming havoc,
    which from me thus hath torn away my leaves,
    collect them at the foot of my sad bush!
    I to that town belonged, which for the Baptist
    changed its first patron; wherefore he, for this,
    will always make her mournful with his art;
    and were it not that on the Arno’s bridge
    there lingers still some little glimpse of him,
    those townsmen who rebuilt her afterward
    over the ashes left by Attila,
    had caused that work to be performed in vain.
    I made myself a gibbet of my house.”

    Since love for my own native place constrained me,
    I gathered up the scattered twigs and leaves,
    and gave them back to him who now was weak.
    Thence to the bound we came, where from the third
    the second ring is severed, and wherein
    a frightful form of Justice may be seen.

    To manifest aright what here was new,
    I say that we had reached a barren plain,
    which from its bed removeth every plant.
    The woeful wood is as a garland round it,
    as round the former is the dismal moat;
    there on its very edge we stayed our steps.
    Its soil was of a dense and arid sand,
    whose nature differed in no way from that,
    which once was trodden by the feet of Cato.

    Vengeance of God, how much by every one
    thou oughtest to be feared, who readeth here
    what to these eyes of mine was manifest!

    Of naked souls I many flocks beheld,
    who all wept very sorely, while on each
    a different law appeared to be imposed.

    A few lay on the ground upon their backs;
    and some were seated cuddled up together,
    while others moved about continually.
    Most numerous were those that moved around,
    and least so those that under torment lay,
    but all the freer had their tongues to wail.

    Down on the whole great waste of sand there rained
    with gentle fall dilated flakes of fire,
    like flakes of snow that fall on windless Alps.
    As were the flames which Alexander saw
    in India’s torrid regions, as they fell
    upon his hosts, unbroken to the ground;
    — and this he met, by ordering his troops
    to trample on the soil, because the flames,
    when single, were more easily put out —
    even such descended here the eternal heat,
    whereby the sand was set on fire, as tinder
    is kindled under steel, to double pain.
    And ever without resting was the dance
    of wretched hands, that kept, now here, now there,
    slapping away each latest burning flake.

    “Thou, Teacher,” I began, “that conquerest all,
    except the stubborn devils who came out
    against us at the entrance of the gate,
    who is that great one who seems not to mind
    the fire, but lies there scornful and awry,
    so that the rain seems not to ripen him?”

    And that same one, who had observed that I
    concerning him was questioning my Leader,
    cried: “As I was alive, such am I dead!
    If Jove should tire that smith of his, from whom,
    in wrath, he took the pointed thunderbolt,
    wherewith I smitten was that final day;
    or should he tire the others, each in turn,
    in Mongibello’s smithy black with smoke,
    by calling out: ‘Help, help, good Vulcan, help!’
    even as he did on Phlegra’s battle-field;
    and should he shoot at me with all his might,
    no glad revenge would he obtain thereby!”

    Thereat my Leader spoke with so much force,
    that I had never heard him use the like:
    “In that thine arrogance, O Capaneus,
    is not extinguished, art thou all the more
    chastised; no torment, saving thine own rage,
    were for thy furious pride a fitting pain.”

    Then with a gentler mien he turned to me,
    and said: “One of the seven kings was he,
    who Thebes besieged; he held, and seems to hold
    God in disdain, and little seems to prize Him;
    but, as I told him, his own spitefulness
    is fit enough adornment for his breast.
    Now follow me, and see that thou meanwhile
    set not thy feet upon the burning sand,
    but to the thicket keep them ever close.”

    In silence we went on, and came to where,
    out of the wood a little stream spirts forth,
    whose ruddy color makes me shudder still.
    As from the Bulicàmë springs a brook,
    which afterward the sinful women share,
    even so went that one down across the sand.
    Its bottom and both sides had turned to stone,
    as also had the embankments on each side;
    I hence perceived the crossing-place was there.

    “Of all the other things which I have shown thee
    since first we entered through the outer gate,
    whose threshold unto no one is denied,
    nothing has ever by thine eyes been seen
    as notable as is this present brook,
    which deadens o’er itself all little flames.”

    These were my Leader’s words; I therefore begged
    that he would freely grant to me the food,
    desire of which he had so freely given.

    “Amid the sea there lies a wasted land,”
    he told me thereupon, “whose name is Crete,
    under whose king the world of old was pure.
    There is a mountain there, which, happy once
    with waters and green leaves, was Ida called;
    ’t is now abandoned like a thing outworn.
    Whilom as trusty cradle for her son
    Rhea selected it, and when he wept,
    to hide him better, caused a shouting there.

    Within that mountain stands a great Old Man,
    who holds his shoulders toward Damiata turned,
    and who, as at his mirror, looks at Rome.
    His head is formed of finest gold, his arms
    and breast are of the purest silver, then,
    as far as to his loins, he ’s made of brass;
    all chosen iron is he down from there,
    save that baked clay his right foot is, and straighter
    he stands on that, than on the other foot.
    Each of these parts, except the golden one,
    is broken by a cleft, whence trickle tears,
    which, when collected, perforate that cave.
    From rock to rock they course into this vale;
    then Acheron with Styx and Phlegethon
    they form, and through this narrow duct descend
    as far as where one goes no further down;
    they form Cocytus there; and what that pool
    is like, thou ’lt see; hence here it is not told.

    And I to him: “If thus this present stream
    hs from our world descended, why alone
    on this ring’s edge hath it appeared to us?”

    And he: “Thou knowest that the place is round,
    and though a long way thou hast gone already,
    e’er to the left descending toward the bottom,
    through the whole circle thou hast not yet gone;
    wherefore, if aught that ’s new appear to us,
    it should not bring amazement to thy face.”

    And I again: “But where are Phlegethon
    and Lethe, Teacher? For, of this one silent,
    thou say’st the other of this rain is made.”

    And he replied: “Thou certainly dost please me
    in all thy questions, but the red stream’s boiling
    ought surely to have answered one of them.
    Lethe thou ’lt see, but there, outside this cave,
    whither souls go to wash themselves, when once
    their sin, repented of, has been removed.”

    And then he said: “It now is time for us
    to leave the wood; see that thou follow me;
    the banks, which are not burned, afford a path;
    and up above them every flame is quenched.”

    One of the hard embankments bears us now,
    and overhead the brook’s mist shades them so,
    that from the fire it saves the stream and banks.

    Such bulwarks as, to keep the sea away,
    the Flemings make between Witsand and Bruges,
    through fearing lest the high-tide break upon them;
    and as the Paduans make along the Brenta,
    their villages and strongholds to defend,
    ere Chiarentana feel the summer heat;
    in such a way were those embankments made,
    although the master did not make them there
    so high or thick, whoe’er he may have been.

    So far we were already from the wood,
    that I could not have seen just where it was,
    even had I turned around to look behind,
    when we a band of spirits met, who came
    along the bank, each one of whom looked hard
    at us, as in the evening one is wont
    to look at people, when the moon is new;
    and toward us they were knitting close their brows,
    as an old tailor at his needle’s eye.

    When by that gathering I had thus been eyed,
    one of them, who had recognized me, seizing
    my garment’s hem, exclaimed: “How wonderful!”

    And I, when toward me he had stretched his arm,
    fastened upon his roasted face mine eyes,
    so that, though blistered, it did not prevent
    mine intellect from recognizing him;
    and downward having bent my face toward his,
    I answered him: “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”

    And that one: “O my son, be not displeased
    should Brunetto Latini a little way
    turn back with thee, and let the troop go on.”

    “I beg you to with all my power;” said I,
    “and if you ’d have me sit with you, I will,
    if it please that one; for with him I go.”

    “O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd
    stands still at all, lies prone a hundred years,
    nor shields himself when smitten by the fire.
    Therefore go on; I ’ll follow at thy skirts,
    and then I ’ll join again my company,
    which goes bewailing its eternal loss.”

    I dared not from the path descend, to go
    upon his level there; but held my head
    bowed down, like one who walks in reverence.

    And he began: “What fortune or what fate
    before thy last day leadeth thee down here,
    and who is he that showeth thee the way?”

    I answered him: “When in the life serene
    up yonder, in a vale I lost my way,
    before my age had rounded out its noon.
    Thereon I turned my back but yestermorn;
    this one, as I returned to it, appeared
    to me, and o’er this path now leads me home.”

    And he to me: “If thine own star thou follow,
    thou canst not fail to reach a glorious port,
    if in the lovely life I judged aright;
    and had I not so prematurely died,
    I, seeing Heaven so well disposed toward thee,
    had given thee comfort in thy work. But that
    ungrateful, wicked people, which of old
    came down from Fièsolë, and which e’en now
    smacks of the mountain and of hard grey stone,
    for thy well-doing shall become thy foe;
    and rightly, for among the acid sorbs
    it is not fitting that sweet figs bear fruit.
    An old fame in the world proclaims them blind,
    a greedy, envious, overweening folk;
    see to it that thou cleanse thee from their ways!
    Thy fortune hath in store for thee such honor,
    that either party shall be hungry for thee;
    but distant from the goat shall be the grass.
    Let, then, the beasts of Fièsolë make litter
    with their own selves, nor let them touch the plant,
    if on their dungheap any burgeon still,

    in which the sacred seed may live again
    of those old Romans who remained therein,
    when of such wickedness the nest was made!”

    “If perfectly fulfilled had been my prayer,”
    I then replied to him, “you had not yet
    been banished from the natural life of man;
    for in my mind is fixed, and stirs e’en now
    my heart, that dear and kind paternal face
    you showed, when in the world from time to time
    you taught me how man makes himself eternal;
    and how much gratitude I feel for this,
    must, while I live, be in my words perceived.
    What of my course you tell, I write, and keep,
    with other texts, for a Lady to explain,
    who can, if ever I attain to her.
    I only wish that this be clear to you,
    that I, if but my conscience chide me not,
    am ready for whatever Fortune wills.
    Not new unto mine ears is such reward;
    hence, as she lists, let Fortune turn her wheel,
    and let the country clown his mattock ply!”

    Thereat my Teacher over his right cheek
    turned back, and looked at me; and then he said:
    “He listens well, who giveth heed to this.”

    Nor speaking less do I, on this account,
    go on with Ser Brunetto, asking who
    his fellows were, of greatest note and rank.

    And he to me: ’T is well to know of some;
    our silence on the rest will merit praise,
    for short the time were for so long a talk.
    Know then, in brief, that clerics were they all,
    and mighty men of letters of great fame,
    soiled by the self same sin when in the world.
    And with that sad crowd yonder Priscian goes,
    and Francis of Accorso, too; and him,
    if thou hadst had a longing for such scurf,
    thou couldst have seen there, whom the servants’ Servant
    changed from the Arno to the Bacchigliònë,
    where he behind him left his ill-strained nerves.
    I ’d speak of more; but I can come and talk
    no further, for a new dust-cloud I see
    rising o’er yonder from the sandy plain.
    People, with whom I must not be, are coming;
    let my Tesoro, in which I ’m still alive,
    be recommended thee; I ask no more.”

    Then round he turned, and seemed to be of those
    who at Verona run across the meadow
    to win the green cloth; and of these he seemed
    not he who loses, but the one who wins.

    I now was where the booming of the water,
    which fell into the following round, was heard
    like the dull, buzzing sound which bee-hives make;
    when three shades separated from a group,
    which ’neath the rain’s tormenting punishment
    was passing by, and ran along together.
    Toward us they came, and each of them cried out:
    “Stop, thou, that by thy garb dost seem to us
    a citizen of our corrupted town!”

    Alas, what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
    both old and recent, by the flames burnt in!
    It pains me still but to remember them.

    My Leader, giving heed to these their cries,
    turned his face round toward me, and said: “Now wait!
    To those men yonder courtesy is due;
    and, were not for the fire, which, arrow-like,
    the nature of the place shoots forth, I ’d say
    that haste were more becoming thee than them.”

    And they, when we had stopped, began again
    their old refrain; and after they had reached us,
    all three of them made of themselves a wheel.

    As champions oiled and nude are wont to do,
    when looking for an advantageous grip,
    before they come to giving blows and wounds;
    thus, as he wheeled, each turned his face toward me,
    so that his feet continuous journey made
    in opposite direction to his neck.

    And one began: “Even if the wretched nature
    of this soft place, and our burned, shrivelled faces
    bring us and our requests into contempt,
    still let our reputation bend thy mind
    to tell us who thou art, that dost so safely
    rub on the soil of Hell thy living feet.
    He, in whose footprints thou dost see me tread,
    was, though he go both nude and hairless now,
    of higher rank then thou believest him.
    He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
    his name was Guido Guerra, and when alive,
    his wisdom and his sword accomplished much.
    The other, who behind me treads the sand,
    Tegghiàio Aldobrandi is, whose voice
    should have been welcomed in the world above.
    And I, who with them am tormented here,
    Iàcopo Rusticucci was; and surely
    my shrewish wife than aught else hurts me more.”

    If I had been protected from the fire,
    I would have lept into their midst below,
    and I believe my Leader had allowed it.

    But since I should have burned and baked myself,
    fear was victorious over my good will,
    which made me eager to embrace them there.

    I then began: “Your state impressed within me
    not scorn, but so much pain, that only late
    will all of it entirely disappear,
    as soon as this my Lord said words to me,
    because of which I thought within myself
    that there were people coming such as you.
    Of your own town am I, and evermore
    have I your doings and your honored names
    related, and heard mentioned, with regard.
    I leave the gall, and for the sweet fruit go,
    which my veracious Leader promised me;
    but to the center must I first descend.”

    “So may thy spirit lead thy members long,”
    the former thereupon replied to me,
    “and, after thou art gone, thy fame be bright,
    tell me if courtesy and worth abide
    within our town, as they were wont to do,
    or whether they have wholly gone from it;
    for Guglielmo Borsierë, who but newly
    has been in pain with us, and with our mates
    goes yonder, grieves us greatly with his words.”

    “The people newly come, and sudden gains,
    have bred in thee such pride and such excess,
    that, Florence, thou art even now in pain!”

    Thus with uplifted face I cried; whereat
    the three, who this as answer understood,
    looked at each other, as one looks at truth.

    “If satisfying others other times
    cost thee so little, happy thou, that thus
    at thy sweet will dost speak!” they all replied.
    “Hence, — so mayst thou, from these dark places saved,
    return to see the lovely stars again, —
    when saying ‘I was there’ shall do thee good,
    see that thou tell the people about us.”
    They then broke up their wheel, and in their flight
    it seemed as if their nimble legs were wings.

    Amen could not have been as quickly said,
    as they then disappeared; my Teacher, therefore,
    thought it advisable for us to leave.

    I followed him, and not far had we gone,
    before the water’s noise was so near by,
    that, had we spoken, we had not been heard.

    And as the stream, which is the first that eastward
    from Monte Veso takes a separate course
    upon the left slope of the Apennines,
    and which above is Acquacheta called,
    before it flows into its lowly bed,
    and at Forlì is of that name deprived,
    booms loud, because of falling o’er a cliff
    above San Benedetto of the Alp,
    where for a thousand there should refuge be;

    even thus, as o’er a precipice it fell,
    we found that colored water roaring so,
    that very soon it would have hurt our ears.

    I had a cord around about me girt,
    wherewith I once had thought that I could capture
    the Leopard with the brightly colored hide.
    When from me I had wholly loosened it,
    even as my Leader had commanded me,
    I coiled it up and held it out to him.
    Thereat upon his right he turned around,
    and hurled it to some distance from the edge
    down into that profound and dark abyss.

    “Surely some strange new thing must needs reply”
    said I within myself, “to this strange signal,
    which with his eye my Teacher follows thus.”

    Ah, with what caution men should deal with those,
    who see not only what is done by others,
    but with their wisdom see into their thoughts!

    He said to me: “What I am waiting for,
    and what thy thought now dreams, will soon come up;
    soon to thy vision will it be revealed.”

    E’er to a truth that hath a falsehood’s face
    ought one to close his lips as best he can,
    for, though one faultless be, it brings him shame;
    but I can not suppress it here; hence, Reader,
    even by the verses of this Comedy,
    so may they not be void of lasting favor,

    I swear to thee, that through that coarse, dark air
    I saw a shape, which would have chilled with wonder
    however brave a heart, come swimming up,
    as he returns, who, going down at times
    to clear an anchor clinging to a reef,
    or aught else lying hidden in the sea,
    above extends, and draweth in below.

INFERNO XVII

The Seventh Circle. The Third Ring

Violence against Art. Usurers

    “Behold the wild beast with the pointed tail,
    which, crossing mountains, breaks through walls and armor;
    behold who sickens all the world with stench!”

    My Leader thus began to speak to me,
    and signalled to it to approach the edge,
    near where the marble we had traversed ended.
    And that foul image of deceit came on,
    and landed on the bank its head and chest;
    but o’er the edge it drew not up its tail.

    Its face was as the face of a just man,
    so pleasing outwardly was its complexion;
    the body of a serpent all the rest.
    Two paws it had, all hairy to the arm-pits;
    its back and breast, as well as both its sides,
    were painted o’er with snares and wheel-like shields.
    Ne’er with more colors in its woof and warp
    did Turks or Tartars manufacture cloth,
    nor by Arachnne were such webs designed.

    As flat-boats sometimes lie upon the shore,
    in water partly, partly on the land;
    and as among the greedy Germans yonder,

    the beaver seats himself to wage his war;
    so lay that worst of beasts upon the edge
    which closes in the sandy plain with stone.
    All of its tail was quivering in the void,
    and twisting upward its envenomed fork,
    which like a scorpion’s weapon armed its tip.

    “Our path must turn aside a little now,”
    my Leader said to me, “until we reach
    that wicked beast reclining over there.”

    Around our right breast, therefore, we went down,
    and took ten paces on the very edge,
    thus surely to avoid both sand and fire;
    and after we had come to it, I saw,
    upon the sand a little further on,
    some people sitting near the precipice.

    My Teacher then: “That thou mayst take with thee
    a full experience of this ring, go on,
    and see the nature of the life they lead.
    There be thy conversation brief; meanwhile,
    till thou return, I ’ll talk with this wild beast,
    that its strong shoulders may be yielded us.”

    Thus further on, along the outer edge
    of that seventh circle, all alone I went,
    to where the melancholy people sat.
    Out of their eyes their woe was bursting forth;
    first here, then there, they helped them with their hands,
    now from the flames, now from the heated soil.

    Not otherwise do dogs in summer-time,
    now with their paws, and with their muzzles now,
    whene’er by flees, or flies, or gadflies bitten.

    When on the face of some I set mine eyes,
    on whom the woeful fire is falling there,
    I knew not one of them; but I perceived
    that from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
    which had a certain color and design,
    wherewith their eyes appeared to feed themselves.
    And as I, looking, came into their midst,
    azure upon a yellow pouch I saw,
    which had the form and semblance of a lion.
    Then, as my gaze continued on its course,
    another I beheld, as red as blood,
    exhibiting a goose more white than butter.

    And one of them, who had his small white pouch
    emblazoned with an azure pregnant sow,
    said to me: “What dost thou in this our ditch?
    Now go thy way; and since thou livest still,
    know that my fellow townsman, Vitaliano,
    will sit beside me here upon my left.
    I, with these Florentines, a Paduan am,
    and very frequently they stun my ears
    by shouting: “Let the sovereign knight arrive,
    who ’ll bring with him the pocket with three beaks!”’
    Herewith his mouth he twisted, sticking out
    his tongue, as doth an ox that licks its nose.

    And I, afraid lest any longer stay
    might anger him who warned me to be brief,
    turned from those weary spirits back again.

    I found my Leader, who had climbed already
    upon the back of that fierce animal,
    and said to me: “Now be thou strong and bold!
    By stairs like these shall we descend hereafter;
    climb thou in front, for midst I wish to be,
    so that the tail may do no injury.”

    Like one with quartan-fever’s chill so near,
    that pale already are his finger nails,
    and that, but looking at the shade, he shudders;
    such at the words he uttered I became;
    but that shame made its threats to me, which renders
    a servant strong when in a good lord’s presence.
    As on those horrid shoulders I sat down,
    I wished to tell him: “See that thou embrace me!”
    my voice, however, came not as I thought.

    But he, who succoured me at other times
    and other straights, as soon as I was up,
    encircled and sustained me with his arms;
    and then he said: “Now, Geryon, move thou on!
    Wide be thy wheels, and gradual thy descent;
    bethink thee of the unwonted load thou hast.”

    As from its mooring place a little boat
    backs slowly out, even so did he withdraw;
    and when he wholly felt himself in play,

    to where his breast had been, he turned his tail,
    and moved the latter, stretched out like an eel,
    while with his paws he gathered in the air.

    I do not think that there was greater fear
    when Phaëthon let go his horses’ reins,
    whereby, as still appears, the sky was burned;
    nor yet when wretched Icarus perceived
    his back unfeathering through the melting wax,
    while, calling him, his father cried: “Thou hold’st
    an evil course!” than mine was, when I saw
    that I was in the air on every side,
    and gone the sight of all things save the beast.

    The latter, swimming, slowly wends his way,
    wheels and descends, but I perceive it not,
    save by the wind below and in my face.
    The waterfall I now heard on the right,
    making a horrid roar beneath us; hence,
    I outward thrust my head with eyes turned down.
    More fearful of the abyss I then became,
    for fires I now beheld, and wailings heard;
    hence, trembling, I clung closer with my thighs.
    And then, for I perceived it not before,
    by the great torments which on divers sides
    drew near, I saw our wheeling and descent.

    Even as a falcon long upon the wing,
    which, without seeing lure or game-bird, makes
    the falconer say: “Alas, thou comest down!”

    descendeth weary, through a hundred rings,
    whence he had swiftly started, and alights
    far from his lord in angry sullenness;
    so likewise Geryon set us down below,
    close to the bottom of the rough-hewn rock;
    and, of our persons rid, as fast as flies
    an arrow from a bowstring, sped away.

INFERNO XVIII

The Eighth Circle. Fraud. The First Trench. Pandars and Seducers. The Second Trench. Flatterers and Prostitutes

    A place there is in Hell, called Malebolgë,
    wholly of stone, and of an iron hue,
    as is the round wall which encircles it.
    Right in the midst of its malicious field
    yawneth a well exceeding wide and deep,
    of whose construction, in its place, I ’ll speak.
    Round, therefore, is the girdle which remains
    between the well and that hard, high wall’s base,
    and ten great trenches subdivide its bed.

    As is the appearance which, where many moats
    encircle castles for the walls’ protection,
    the section where they are presents;
    such was the one those trenches furnished here;
    and just as in such fortresses small bridges
    stretch from their thresholds to the outmost bank;
    so crags ran from the bottom of the cliff
    across the banks and trenches to the well,
    which, gathering them together, cuts them off.

    In this place, then, we found ourselves, when dropped
    from Geryon’s back; the Poet thereupon
    held to the left, and I behind him moved.

    Upon the right side I beheld new cause
    for sympathy, new pains, and scourgers new,
    wherewith the first trench was completely filled.
    Down at its bottom naked were the sinners;
    this side the middle facing us they came,
    beyond it with us, but with quicker steps;
    means such as those which at the Jubilee
    the Romans took, because of its great throng,
    to have the people pass across the bridge,
    who toward the Castle all on one side face,
    and toward Saint Peter’s go their way; while all
    move toward the mountain on the other edge.

    This side and that, upon the dark, stone floor,
    horned demons with great scourges I beheld,
    who from behind were fiercely whipping them.
    Ah, how they caused them to lift them up their heels,
    when by the first blows smitten! Certainly
    none waited for the second, or the third.

    While I was going on, mine eyes were met
    by one of them; and instantly I said:
    “I fast not from a previous sight of him.”
    To make him out I therefore stayed my feet;
    and, having stopped with me, my gentle Leader
    assented to my going back a little.

    That scourged one thought that he could hide himself
    by looking down, but little it availed him;
    for “Thou, that castest down thine eyes,” said I,

    unless the features which thou hast are false,
    Venèdico Caccianimico art;
    but what brings thee into such pungent sauces?”

    And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;
    but forced I am by thy transparent speech,
    which makes me recollect the olden world.
    I was the one who led Ghisolabella
    to do according to the Marquis’ will,
    however the disgusting tale be told.
    Nor am I here the only Bolognese
    that weeps; nay, this place is so full of us,
    that not so many tongues are taught today
    between Savena and Reno to say sipa;
    and if thereof thou wouldst have pledge or proof,
    recall to mind our avaricious breasts.”

    As thus he spoke, a demon with his lash
    smote him, and said to him: “Pandar, begone!
    There are no women here to sell for coin.”

    I then rejoined my Escort; whereupon,
    when we had taken some few steps, we came
    to where a crag projected from the bank.
    This we ascended with the greatest ease,
    and turning to the right along its ridge,
    we left those everlasting circling walls.

    When we were where it hollows out below,
    to let the scourged pass through, my Leader said:
    “Now stay thy steps, and on thee let the sight

    of all these other ill-born spirits strike,
    whose faces thou hast not perceived as yet,
    because they ’ve gone with us in our direction.”

    As from the ancient bridge we watched the troop,
    which on the other side was toward us coming,
    and which the scourge was likewise driving on,
    without my asking, my good Teacher said:
    “Look at that great man there, who, as he comes,
    for all his pain, seems not to shed a tear.
    How royal an appearance he still keeps!
    Jason is he, who, by his doughtiness
    and wit, deprived the Colchians of their ram.
    He passed the isle of Lemmos on his way,
    after its pitiless and daring women
    had given up to death their every male.
    With tokens of his love and flattering words
    he there deceived the maid, Hypsìpylë,
    who previously had all the rest deceived.
    He left her there with child, and all alone;
    him to this punishment that fault condemns;
    and for Medea, too, is vengeance wrought.
    With him go those that in this way deceive;
    be this enough to know of this first ditch,
    and of those, too, that in its fangs it holds.”

    Already were we where the narrow path
    forms with the second bank a cross, and makes
    therewith abutments for another arch.

    We thence heard people in the following trench
    who whined and groaned, and with their muzzles puffed,
    while smiting their own bodies with their palms.
    The banks were crusted over with a mould
    by vapor from below, which, sticking there,
    offensive to both eyes and nose became.
    So deep the bottom, that there is no means
    of looking into it, unless one climb
    the arch’s summit, where the crag is highest.
    Thither we came, and from it in the ditch
    people I saw immersed in excrement,
    which seemed from human privies to have come.

    While peering with mine eyes down there, I saw
    a head so foul with filth, that whether clerk’s
    or layman’s head it were, was not apparent.
    Scolding, he said: “Why greedier art thou
    to look at me, than at the other foul ones?”

    And I: “Because, if I remember well,
    I ’ve seen thee with dry hair ere now, for thou
    Alèssio Interminèi of Lucca art;
    that ’s why I eye thee more than all the rest.”
    And he then, as he beat upon his pate:
    “Those flatteries immersed me here below,
    wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”

    Then, after this, my Leader said to me:
    “See that thou urge thy glance a little further,
    that with thine eyes thou quite attain the face

    of that disgusting and dishevelled wench,
    who yonder claws herself with filthy nails,
    and crouches now, and now is on her feet.
    That Thaïs is, the prostitute, who answered
    her paramour, when he had said ‘Have I
    great thanks from thee?’: ‘Nay, marvelously great!’
    Herewith, then, let our sight be satisfied.”

The Third Trench. Simoniacs

    O Simon Magus, O his wretched followers,
    since ye the things of God, which ought to be
    the brides of righteousness, rapaciously
    adulterate for silver and for gold;
    it now behooves the trumpet sound for you,
    for in the third great trench your station is!

    We now had climbed the next tomb-spanning bridge,
    and were on that part of the crag, which hangs
    directly o’er the middle of the trench.

    Wisdom Supreme, how great the art thou showest
    in Heaven, on earth, and in the evil world!
   
    How justly, too, thy virtue makes awards!

    I saw that on its sloping sides and bottom
    the livid-colored stone was full of holes,
    all of one width, while each of them was round.
    Nor less nor more wide did they seem to me,
    than those which in my beautiful Saint John’s
    are made as places for baptizing priests;
    and one of which, not many years ago,
    I broke, to save one who was choking in it;
    be this a witness undeceiving all!

    Out of the mouth of each a sinner’s feet
    protruded, and, as far as to the calf,
    his legs; the rest of him remained within.
    The soles of all were, both of them, on fire;
    because of which their joints so strongly twitched,
    they would have snapped green twigs and cords of grass.
    And as a flame on oily things is wont
    to move along the outer surface only;
    so likewise was it there from heels to toes.

    “Who, Teacher, is he yonder, who is tortured
    by twitching more than all the rest, his mates,”
    said I, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”

    And he to me: “If thou wouldst have me bear thee
    down yonder bank which lowest lies, from him
    thou ’lt know both of himself and of his sins.”

    And I: “What pleases thee I like; my lord
    thou art, and that I part not from thy will
    thou knowst, as also what is left unsaid.”

    We then upon the fourth embankment came,
    and, turning round, descended on our left
    into that narrow bottom pierced with holes;
    nor yet did my good Teacher set me down
    from off his back, but brought me to the hole
    of him who grieved so sorely with his shank.

    “Whoe’er thou art, sad soul, that holdest down
    thine upper portion, planted like a stake,”
    I then began, “say something, if thou canst.”

    I there was like a friar that confesses
    a base assassin, who, on being planted,
    calls him again, that death may be delayed.

    And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,
    dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
    By several years the writing lied to me.
    Art thou so quickly sated with the wealth,
    for which thou didst not fear to seize by fraud,
    and outrage next, the Lady beautiful?”

    Even such did I become, as those are, who,
    not understanding what is answered them,
    deem themselves mocked, and think of no reply.
    Then Virgil said: “Tell him immediately:
    ‘I ’m not the one, I ’m not the one thou thinkest!’”
    And I replied to him as I was bidden.

    Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet;
    then, sighing, and with weeping voice, he said:
    “What is it, then, that thou dost ask of me?
    If to know who I am concern thee so,
    that for it thou hast crossed the bank; know, then,
    that I was with the mighty Mantle clothed;
    and verily the she-Bear’s son was I,
    so eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
    I pocketed up there, and here myself.
    The others, who in working simony
    preceded me, are gathered ’neath my head,
    flattened between the fissures of the rock.

    I, in like manner, shall down yonder fall,
    when he arrives, whom I believed thou wast,
    when I of thee the sudden question asked.
    But now already longer is the time,
    that I, thus up-side down, have cooked my feet,
    than he will planted stay with ruddy soles;
    for after him shall come from westward lands
    a lawless shepherd of still uglier deed,
    and fit to cover him and me. Renewed
    shall Jason be, of whom in Maccabees
    one reads; and as to that one his king yielded,
    even so who governs France shall yield to this.”

    I know not whether I was here too bold,
    in that I answered him in this strain only:
    “Now tell me, pray, how great the treasure was,
    our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
    before He placed the Keys in his control?
    Surely he asked for naught but ‘Follow me.’
    Nor yet did Peter or the rest take gold
    or silver from Matthias, when by lot
    he took the place the guilty soul had lost.
    Therefore keep still, for thou art rightly punished;
    and take good care of that ill-gotten wealth,
    which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
    And were it not for this, that I am still
    forbidden by reverence for the Keys supreme
    thou hadst in keeping in the joyful life,

    words of still greater weight would I employ;
    because your greed, by trampling on the good
    and raising the depraved, afflicts the world.
    The Evangelist was thinking of your shepherds,
    when she, who on the waters hath her seat,
    was seen by him to fornicate with kings;
    the one who with the seven heads was born,
    and from the ten horns her support received,
    while virtue still was pleasing to her spouse.
    Ye’ ve made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
    and from idolaters how differ ye,
    save that they worship one, and ye a hundred?

    Ah, Constantine, of how much ill was mother,
    not thy conversion, but the dower-gift
    the earliest wealthy Father took from thee!”

    While I was singing him such notes as these,
    he, whether it were wrath or conscience bit him,
    was fiercely kicking out with both his feet.
    I verily believe it pleased my Leader,
    he heeded with so glad a look throughout
    the utterance of those true, clear words of mine.
    He therefore took me up with both his arms,
    and when he had me wholly on his breast,
    he climbed again the path down which he came;
    nor tired of holding me in his embrace,
    but bore me to the summit of the arch,
    which crosses from the fourth bank to the fifth.

    When there, he gently set his burden down,
    gently, because that crag was rough and steep,
    and would be difficult for goats to cross;
    from thence another trench was shown to me.

INFERNO XX

The Fourth Trench. Diviners and Soothsayers

    About strange punishments must I make verses,
    and furnish matter for the twentieth song
    of this first lay, which treats of those submerged.

    Already had I wholly given myself
    to looking down at its uncovered bottom,
    which with the tears of agony was bathed;
    when people in the great round trench I saw
    come weeping silently, and at the pace,
    at which in this world litanies advance.

    Then, as my sight fell on them lower down,
    wondrously twisted each of them appeared
    between the chin and where the chest begins;
    for toward his loins his face was turned around,
    and backward it behooved him to advance,
    because of foresight they had been deprived.

    By palsy some, perhaps, may thus have been
    entirely turned around, but I ’ve not seen it,
    nor do I think there ever was one such.

    So may God let thee, Reader, gather fruit
    from this thy reading, think now for thyself
    how I could ever keep my own face dry,

    when at close range I saw our human image
    so twisted, that the weeping of the eyes
    along the fissure bathed the back. Indeed,
    as on a rock of that hard crag I leaned,
    I wept so, that my Escort said to me:
    “Art thou still foolish as the others are?
    Here liveth piety when wholly dead
    is pity. Who, then, guiltier is than he
    who lets his feelings judge Divine Decrees?

    Lift, lift thy head, and see the man for whom,
    before the Trojans’ eyes, the earth was opened!
    whence all cried: ‘Whither art thou rushing now,
    Amphiaràus? Why quittest thou the war?’
    and he ceased not from plunging headlong down
    to Minos, who lays hold on every one.
    See how he makes a bosom of his shoulders;
    because he wished to see too far ahead,
    he looks behind, and backward goes his way.

    Behold Tiresias there, who changed his looks,
    when female he became, from being male,
    his members being each and all transformed;
    and afterward he needs must strike again
    the two entwining serpents with his rod,
    ere he the plumage of a male regained.

    He who to that one’s belly turns his back,
    is Aruns, who in Luni’s mountain quarries,
    where toils the Carrarese who dwells below,

    among white marbles had as dwelling-place
    a cave, from which his view was not cut off,
    when at the stars he gazed, or at the sea.

    And she who, yonder, with dishevelled locks
    covers the breasts which thou dost not behold,
    and has on that side all her hairy skin,
    was Manto, who first searched through many lands,
    then settled in the place where I was born;
    thereof I ’d have thee hear me speak a little.

    After her father had from life departed,
    and Bacchus’ city had become enslaved,
    she wandered long about the world. Up there
    in lovely Italy, beneath the Alps
    which o’er the Tyrol lock out Germany,
    there lies a lake which is Benàco called.
    From o’er a thousand springs, I trow, ’tween Garda
    and Val Camònica, the Pennine Alp
    is bathed by waters which therein find rest.
    A midway place there is, where Trento’s shepherd,
    and he of Brescia, and the Veronese,
    might each his blessing give, if there he went.
    Peschiera next, a fair and mighty fortress,
    and fit to face both Bergamasks and Brescians,
    sits where the shore lies lowest round about.
    There all that in Benàco’s spacious lap
    cannot be held, flows out of it perforce,
    and down through verdant pastures forms a stream.

    When once its water gathers head to run,
    no more Benàco, Mincio is its name,
    till at Govèrnolo it joins the Po.
    Not long its course, before it finds low ground,
    o’er which it spreads, and, making it a marsh,
    is wont at times to be unsound in summer.

    Passing that way, the cruel virgin saw
    a region in the middle of the fen,
    untilled and naked of inhabitants.
    There, to escape all human fellowship,
    and work her arts, she settled with her slaves,
    and lived, and there she left her empty body.
    Thereafter men, who all around were scattered,
    collected in that place, which was a strong one,
    because it had a fen on every side.
    O’er those dead bones of hers they built a town;
    then, after her, who first picked out the site,
    they called it Mantua, with no other lot.
    The people in it were more numerous once,
    before the foolishness of Casalodi
    had been deceived by Pinamonte’s guile.
    I charge thee, then, if e’er thou hear it said
    my town had its beginning otherwise,
    permit no falsehood to defraud the truth.”

    “Thy statements, Teacher, are so sure to me,”
    said I, “and take such hold upon my faith,
    that those of others would be burnt-out coals.

    But tell me if among these passing people
    thou seest any one deserving note;
    for my mind now is wholly bent on that.”

    He told me then: “The one who from his cheeks
    extends his beard across his swarthy shoulders,
    an augur was, when Greece lacked males so much,
    that for her cradles only few were left;
    ’t was he who set, with Chalcas’ aid, at Aulis
    the time to cut the fleet’s first rope. His name
    Eurỳpylus, and in a certain place
    he thus is called by my high Tragedy;
    this thou know’st well, who knowest all of it.
    That other one, so thin about his flanks,
    was Michael Scot, who surely understood
    the artful game of magical deceits.
    Guido Bonatti see; and see Asdente,
    who wishes now that he had given heed
    to cord and leather, but too late repents.
    See the sad women who abandoned needles,
    spindles and shuttles, to become diviners;
    these wrought their spells with herbs and images.

    But now come on, for Cain is with his thorns
    holding the bounds of both the hemispheres,
    and plays upon the waves below Seville,
    and round already was the moon last night;
    thou surely must recall it, since at times,
    it harmed thee not, when in the dark wood’s depths.”

    Thus he to me, as, meanwhile, on we went.

    Speaking of other things my Comedy
    cares not to sing, we thus from bridge to bridge
    moved on, and, when upon the summit, stopped,
    in order to behold the next ravine
    of Malebòlgë, and the next vain cries;
    and I beheld it wonderfully dark.

    And just such sticky pitch as that which boils
    in the Venetians’ Arsenal in winter,
    for calking up again the unsound ships,
    which cannot then be sailed; — instead of which,
    as one a new one builds, one plugs the ribs
    of that which many voyages has made;
    one hammers at the stern, and at the prow another;
    one fashions oars, another cordage twists,
    while still another mends a jib or mainsail; —
    such was the coarse, dense pitch, which, not by fire,
    but by an art divine, boiled there below,
    and limed the bank on every side. I saw
    the pitch, but nothing in it, save the bubbles
    the boiling raised, and that the whole of it
    kept swelling up, and settling back compressed.

    While I was gazing fixedly down yonder,
    my Leader cried to me: “Beware, beware!”
    and drew me to himself from where I was.
    I then turned round, as one who longs to see
    the thing which it behooves him to escape,
    and who, when by a sudden fear unmanned,
    although he sees, delays not his departure;
    and I perceived behind us a black devil
    come running up along the rocky crag.

    Ah, how ferocious in his looks he was,
    and in his actions how severe he seemed,
    with wings outspread, and light upon his feet!
    His shoulder, which was sharp and high, was loaded
    with both a sinner’s haunches, whom he held
    clutched tightly by the sinews of his feet.

    “O Malebranche,” from our bridge he cried,
    “here ’s one of Santa Zita’s Ancients! Put him
    beneath, for I ’m for more of them returning
    to that town which I have well stocked therewith;
    there, save Bonturo, every one ’s a grafter;
    a ‘No’ for money there becomes a ‘Yes.’”

    He hurled him down, and o’er the rugged crag
    returned; and never was a mastif loosed
    with so much hurry to pursue a thief.

    The other sank, and then rose doubled up;
    those fiends, though, who were sheltered by the bridge,
    cried: “Here the Holy Face availeth not!

    One here swims otherwise than in the Serchio!
    If, therefore, thou dost not desire our hooks,
    protrude not from the surface of the pitch.”

    They pricked him then with o’er a hundred prongs,
    and said: “Here under cover must thou dance,
    that, if thou canst, thou mayst thieve secretly.”
    Not otherwise do cooks have scullions plunge
    the meat with hooks into the cauldron’s midst,
    to hinder it from floating on its surface.

    Thereat my kindly Teacher said to me:
    “That here thy presence be not known, crouch down
    behind a rock, which may avail to screen thee;
    and be not thou afraid, for any harm
    that may be done to me, who know these things,
    for I in frays like this have been before.”

    He then passed on beyond the bridge’s head,
    and when the sixth embankment had been reached,
    he had to show assurance in his face.
    With just the storm and fury wherewith dogs
    break out and rush upon a poor old man,
    who stops and begs at once from where he is;
    from ’neath the little bridge those devils issued,
    and turned against him all their grappling hooks;
    but he cried out: “Be none of you malicious!
    Before your grappling hooks take hold of me,
    let one of you advance, and hear me speak;
    then take ye counsel as to grappling me.”

    Then all cried out: “Let Malacoda go!”
    Thereat one started, while the rest kept still,
    and, as he came, said: “What does this avail him?”

    “Dost thou think, Malacoda,” said my Teacher,
    “that, as thou seest, I have hither come,
    safe until now from all your hindrances,
    unhelped by Will Divine and favoring fate?
    Let us go on, for it is willed in Heaven
    that I should show another this wild road.”

    Thereat his pride received so great a fall,
    that at his feet he dropped his grappling hook,
    and to the rest said: “Let him not be wounded.”

    My Leader thereupon cried out to me:
    “Thou that among the bridge’s broken rocks
    art crouching, safely now regain my side.”

    I therefore moved, and quickly came to him;
    then all the fiends advanced so far, I feared
    they would not keep their word. Even thus I once
    saw infantry, who, under pledge of safety,
    were from Caprona coming forth, afraid,
    when ’mong so many foes they saw themselves.
    Then wholly to my Leader’s side I drew,
    nor from their faces, which did not look good,
    did I remove my eyes. For as their prongs
    they lowered, one fiend to another said:
    “Wouldst thou that I should touch him on his rump?”
    and they replied: “Yes, see thou nick it for him!”

    But that fiend, who was with my Leader talking,
    turned round at once, and said to him: “Keep still,
    keep still there, Scarmiglionë!” Then to us:
    “Further advance along this present crag
    can not be made, because the sixth arch yonder
    lies wholly shattered on the ground below;
    but if it please you still to go ahead,
    go on along this ridge; there is near by
    another crag which furnishes a path.
    Than this hour five hours later yesterday,
    twelve hundred, six and sixty years had passed,
    since here the path was broken. I am sending
    some of my company in that direction,
    to see if any yonder air themselves;
    go on with them, for they will not be bad.”

    “Step forward, Alichino, and Calcabrina,”
    he then began to say, “thou, too, Cagnazzo;
    and let old Barbariccia guide the ten.
    Have Libicocco go, and Draghignazzo;
    tusked Ciriatto, too, and Graffiacane,
    with Farfarello and crazy Rubicante.
    Search round about the boiling birdlime pitch;
    let these be safe as far as that next crag,
    which all unbroken goes across the dens.”

    “Oh, Teacher, what is this I see?” said I.
    “If thou know how, pray let us go alone,
    for I request no escort for myself.

    If thou as wary art as thou art wont,
    dost thou not notice how they gnash their teeth,
    and with their eyebrows threaten us with woe?”

    And he to me: “I would not have thee frightened;
    let them grin on, then, as they like, for that
    they ’re doing at the wretches who are boiled.”

    They wheeled, and moved along the left bank then;
    but not till each, as signal toward their leader,
    had first thrust out his tongue between his teeth,
    and he had of his rump a trumpet made.

    Ere now have I seen cavalry break camp,
    start to attack, or be reviewed, and even,
    at times, retreat, in order to escape;
    scouts have I also seen upon your lands,
    O Aretines; raids, too, have I beheld,
    and tournaments and tilting-matches fought;
    with trumpets now, and now with bells, with drums
    and beacon-signals made from fortresses,
    with native and with foreign things; but never
    have I seen horse, or infantry, or ship,
    by sign of either land or sky, set out
    with instrument of wind as odd as that.

    With the ten demons we were going on;
    ah, the fierce company! But in a church
    with saints consort, with gluttons at an inn!
    Upon the pitch alone was I intent,
    that I might see all details of the trench
    and of the people who were burned therein.

    As dolphins do, when, arching up their backs,
    they give the warning which bids mariners
    take measures for the safety of their ship;

    even so at times, his suffering to relieve,
    one of the sinners there displayed his back,
    and hid it in less time than lightning takes.

    And as in ditches at the water’s edge
    frogs stay with nothing but their muzzles out,
    and thus conceal their feet and all the rest;
    even so on all sides did those sinners stay;
    and now that Barbariccia was approaching,
    they likewise ’neath the boiling pitch withdrew.

    I saw, and still it stirs my heart with horror,
    one waiting thus, as oft, while one frog stays,
    it happens that another scurries off.
    And Graffiacane, who was nearest to him,
    hooking his pitch-smeared tresses, pulled him up,
    so that an otter he appeared to me.

    I knew by now the names of each and all,
    I noted them so well when they were chosen,
    and, when they called each other, noticed how.
    “O Rubicante, see thou set thy claws
    upon him so, that thou peel off his skin!”
    the accursèd all cried out together then.

    And I: “My Teacher, if thou canst, contrive
    to learn who that wretch is, who thus
    has fallen into his adversaries’ hands.”

    My Leader thereupon drew near to him,
    and asked him whence he was, and he replied:
    “Of Navarre’s kingdom I a native was.

    My mother placed me out to serve a lord,
    for she had borne me to a rascal knave,
    who both himself and what he owned destroyed.
    I next in good King Thibaut’s household served,
    and there I set myself to practice graft,
    for which I pay the reckoning in this heat.”

    Here Ciriatto, from whose mouth protruded,
    as from a boar’s, a tusk on either side,
    caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
    Among bad cats the mouse had fallen now;
    for Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
    and said: “Stand off, while I am clutching him!”
    Then, toward my Teacher having turned his face,
    he said: “Ask him again, if more thou wish
    to know of him, before the others rend him.”

    My Leader then: “Now tell me: know’st thou any,
    among the other sinners ’neath the pitch,
    who Latin is?” And he: “Not long ago
    I left a man from that vicinity;
    would that like him I still were covered up,
    for I should then fear neither claw nor hook!”

    Here Libicocco said: “We ’ve borne too much!”
    and with his hook so seized him by the arm,
    and tore it, that he carried off a piece.
    And Draghignazzo also wished to clutch him
    down at his legs; but their decurion then
    turned right around at them with threatening looks.

    When they were somewhat pacified again,
    of him, who still was looking at his wound,
    my Leader asked without delay: “Who, then,
    was he, from whom thou tookst unlucky leave,
    as thou hast said, to land upon the shore?”

    And he made answer: “That was Fra Gomita,
    Gallura’s man, a vessel of all fraud,
    who, when he held in hand his master’s foes,
    so dealt with them that each is glad. Their money
    he took, and, as he puts it, let them all
    off easy, and even in other offices
    was not a petty, but a first rate grafter.
    With him Don Michel Zanche of Logodoro
    associates; and never do their tongues
    feel tired out by talking of Sardinia.
    But oh! Look at the other grinning there!
    More would I say, but am afraid lest that one
    be making ready now to claw my skin.”

    Then the great provost turned toward Farfarello,
    who rolled his eyes as if he meant to strike,
    and said: “Off yonder, thou malicious bird!”

    “If you desire” thereat began again
    the terror-stricken man, “to see or hear
    Tuscans or Lombards, I will have some come.
    But let the Evil Claws here stand aside
    a little, that their vengeance be not feared,
    and I, while sitting in this very place,

    for one that I am, shall make seven come out,
    when I shall whistle, as our wont it is,
    when any one of us protrudes himself.”

    Cagnazzo at this speech his muzzle raised,
    and shook his head, and said: “Hear the sly trick
    devised by him to cast himself below!”

    Then he, who frauds in great abundance had,
    replied to him: “Tricky indeed am I,
    when for my mates a greater pain I win!”

    Here Alichìn could not control himself,
    but said, in opposition to the rest:
    “I shall not gallop after thee, in case
    thou dive, but o’er the pitch shall beat my wings;
    the ridge abandoned, be the bank a screen,
    to see if thou alone art more than we!”

    Now, Reader, of a new sport shalt thou hear!
    Each turned his eyes the other way; and he
    the first, who had thereto been most opposed.
    The Navarrese chose well his time, stood firmly
    upon the ground, and, jumping suddenly,
    from what they purposed freed himself thereby.
    For this each felt himself to blame, but most
    the one who of the loss had been the cause;
    hence he moved first, and shouted: “Thou art caught!”
    But little did it profit him; for wings
    could not outmeasure fear; as one went under,
    the other, flying upward, raised his breast;

    nor different is the speed with which a duck
    dives under water, when a hawk draws near,
    who, vexed and baffled thus, flies up again.

    Then Calcabrina, angered by the flout,
    flew out behind him, glad that one escaped,
    because it let him scuffle with the other;
    and then, the grafter having disappeared,
    he turned his claws upon his own companion,
    and grappled with him o’er the ditch; but he,
    being, indeed, a fighting sparrow-hawk
    fitted to claw him well, they both fell down
    into the middle of the boiling fen.
    A sudden separator was the heat;
    but rising thence was quite impossible,
    they had their wings so limed with sticky pitch.

    Then Barbariccia, vexed as were the rest,
    his mates, had four of them with all their hooks
    fly to the other bank; on both sides then
    they speedily descended to their posts,
    and stretched their hooks out toward the pitch-belimed,
    who now were cooked inside their crusted hides;
    and, thus embarassed, we abandoned them.

INFERNO XXIII

The Eighth Circle. Fraud

The Sixth Trench. Hypocrites

    Silent, alone, and unaccompanied,
    we went along, one first and one behind,
    as Minor Friars go when on the road.

    My thoughts, by reason of the present brawl,
    were turned to Aesop’s fable, that wherein
    he talks about the frog and mouse; for ‘now’
    and ‘at this moment’ are no more alike,
    than one is like the other, if beginning
    and end be linked by an attentive mind.
    And ev’n as one thought from another springs,
    so, next, from that one was another born,
    which doubled my first fear. Hence thus I thought:
    “These devils have been scorned on our account,
    and with such injury and scoff, indeed,
    that I believe that they are greatly vexed.
    If anger to ill-will be joined, they ’ll come
    more fiercely after us, than doth a dog
    the rabbit which he seizes with his teeth.”

    Already was I feeling all my hair
    bristling with fear, when, gazing back intent,
    I said: “If, Teacher, thou hide not thyself

    and me with speed, I dread the Evilclaws;
    we have them now behind us, and I so
    imagine them, that I already feel them.”

    And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,
    thine outward image I would not reflect
    more quickly than thine inward I receive.
    Even now thy thoughts were coming among mine
    with outlook and intent so similar,
    that I with both a single purpose formed.
    If it be true the right bank slopeth so,
    that to the following trench we can descend,
    we shall escape from this imagined chase.”

    He had not finished telling me his plan,
    when not far off I saw them coming on
    with wings outspread, intent on seizing us.

    My Leader then took hold of me at once,
    even as a mother, by the noise aroused,
    and seeing close to her the burning flames,
    seizes her child and flees, and doth not stop,
    since caring more for him than for herself,
    even long enough to clothe her with a shift;
    and downward from the ridge of that hard bank,
    his back he yielded to the hanging rock,
    which closes one side of the following trench.

    Water ne’er moved as swiftly through a sluice,
    to turn the overshot wheel of a mill,
    when closest to the paddles it approaches,

    as did my Teacher o’er that selvage-bank,
    bearing me down with him upon his back,
    as though his son I were, and not his mate.

    His feet had hardly reached the trench’s bed
    below, when they were on the ridge above,
    just over us; but naught was now to fear;
    because the Providence on high, which willed
    to place them in the fifth trench as its servants,
    takes from them all the power of leaving it.

    A painted people found we there below,
    who, moving with exceedingly slow steps,
    shed tears, and in their looks appeared subdued
    and weary. Cloaks they had equipped with cowls
    lowered before their eyes, and cut like those
    which in Cologne are fashioned for her monks.
    So gilded outside are they that they dazzle;
    but inside all are lead, and of such weight,
    that those which Frederick clothed men with were straw.
    O cloak that wearies through eternity!

    We turned again, as ever, to the left,
    along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
    but, owing to the weight, that weary folk
    came on so slowly, that new company
    we had at every motion of our legs.
    Hence to my Leader I: “Contrive to find
    some one whom we may know by deed or name,
    and, while thus going, move thine eyes around.”

    And one, who heard my Tuscan speech, cried out
    behind us: “Stay your feet, O ye that run
    so quickly through the gloomy air! From me,
    perhaps, shalt thou receive what thou dost ask.”
    Thereat my Leader turned and said: “Now wait;
    and then proceed according to his pace.”

    I stopped, and two I saw, whose faces showed
    great mental haste to be with me, and yet
    their burden and the narrow path delayed them.
    On coming up to us, they watched me long
    with eyes askance, and uttered not a word;
    then, toward each other turning, thus they spoke:
    “This one seems by the action of his throat
    alive; but if they ’re dead, by what right, then,
    go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”

    And then, addressing me, they said: “O Tuscan,
    who to the gathering of sad hypocrites
    art come, scorn not to tell us who thou art.”

    And I to them: “On Arno’s lovely stream,
    and in its famous town, both born and bred,
    I’m in the body I have always had.
    But who are ye, adown whose cheeks there drips,
    as I perceive, so great a woe, and what
    the penalty which sparkles on you thus?”

    “These orange cloaks,” one answered, “are of lead,
    and of such thickness are they, that the weights
    thus cause the scales that balance them to creak.

    We Jovial Friars were, and Bolognese;
    I, Catalàn, and Loderingo he,
    by name, and chosen by thy town together,
    as one alone is usually called,
    to keep its peace; and such we were, as still
    in the Gardingo’s neighborhood appears.”

    “O friars,” I began, “your evil deeds . . .”
    but said no more; because there struck mine eyes
    one crucified by three stakes on the ground.
    On seeing me, sighs through his beard he blew,
    and writhed all over; then Fra Catalàn,
    informed thereby of what had happened, said:

    “The pinioned man thou gazest at, advised
    the Pharisees that it expedient was
    to torture one man for the people’s sake.
    Stretched crosswise, as thou seest, on the road,
    and naked, he is forced to be the first
    to feel how much whoever passes weighs.
    And in like fashion suffer in this ditch
    his father-in-law, and others of the council
    which proved a seed of evil for the Jews.”

    I then saw Virgil marvelling at him,
    who in the figure of a cross was stretched
    so basely in eternal banishment.

    Then to the friar he addressed these words:
    “Be not displeased to tell us, an ye may,
    if on the right there lie a crossing-place,

    by means of which we two may issue hence,
    without black Angels being forced to come
    and extricate us from this trench’s bed.”

    “Nearer than thou dost hope” he then replied,
    “a crag there is, which at the great round wall
    begins, and all the cruel trenches spans,
    save that at this one it is broken down,
    and spans it not; but ye can climb the ruins,
    which from its base lie piled along the slope.”

    My Leader kept his head bowed down awhile;
    then said: “Wrongly did he report the thing,
    who yonder grapples sinners with his hook!”

    The friar then: “Among the many vices given
    the Devil at Bologna, I once heard
    that he a liar is, and sire of lies.”

    Thereat my Leader with great strides departed,
    somewhat disturbed by anger in his looks;
    then I the burdened left, and followed on
    behind the footprints of belovèd feet.

INFERNO XXIV

The Eighth Circle. Fraud

The Seventh Trench. Thieves

    When in the youthful season of the year
    the sun beneath Aquarius warms his locks,
    while southward now the nights pursue their way;
    and when the hoar-frost draws upon the ground
    the counterfeit of her white sister’s face,
    though shortly lasts the temper of her pen;
    the peasant, lacking provender, gets up,
    looks out, and, seeing all the country white,
    slaps himself on the thigh, returns in doors,
    and walking to and fro, laments, poor wretch,
    not knowing what to do; then later on
    returning out again, recovers hope,
    on seeing that the world has shortly changed
    its face; and, taking down his shepherd-staff,
    out to their feeding drives his tender sheep.

    Even thus my Teacher filled me with dismay,
    when I beheld such trouble in his face;
    thus, too, the plaster quickly reached the wound;
    for when we had attained the ruined bridge,
    my Leader turned to me with that sweet look,
    which at the Mountain’s foot I first perceived.

    First having well surveyed the ruined arch,
    after some counsel taken with himself,
    his arms he opened, and took hold of me.
    And like a man who ponders while he acts,
    and always seems to look ahead; ev’n so,
    while upward to the top of one great rock
    he pushed me, he sought out another crag,
    and said: “Take hold of that one next, but first
    see whether it be fit to bear thy weight.”

    No path was this for one who wore a cloak,
    since scarcely could we two, though he was light,
    and I was pushed, ascend from rock to rock.
    And had the slope on that bank not been shorter,
    than on the other, I know not of him,
    but I would surely have been overcome;
    but since the whole of Malebolgë slopes
    down to the opening of the lowest well,
    such is the nature of each trench’s banks,
    that one is high, and low the following one;
    and yet we reached at length the ridge above,
    from which the crag’s last rock projects.
    My breath was so exhausted from my lungs,
    when up at last, that I could go no further;
    nay, on arriving I sat down at once.

    “Thus, henceforth, must thou rid thyself of sloth,”
    my Teacher said; “for one attains not fame,
    sitting on cushions, or ’neath canopies;

    and he that lives without attaining it,
    leaveth on earth such traces of himself,
    as smoke doth in the air, or foam in water.
    Therefore get up! O’ercome thy troubled breath
    with that soul-energy, which wins all fights,
    unless it sink beneath its body’s weight!
    A longer stairway must be climbed; ’t is not
    enough that these stairs have been left; if, then,
    thou understand me, let it profit thee.”

    I thereupon arose, and showed myself
    better equipped with breath than I had felt,
    and said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold!”

    We took the pathway up along the crag,
    which rocky was, narrow and hard to climb,
    and steeper far than was the one before.
    Not to seem weak, I talked as on I went;
    this from the next trench caused a voice to come,
    which was incapable of forming words.
    Though I was on the summit of the arch
    which crosses here, I know not what it said;
    but moved to anger seemed the one who spoke.
    Downward I looked, and yet my living eyes
    could not attain the bottom for the dark;
    hence, “Teacher, try to reach the following ridge,”
    said I, “and let us from the wall descend,
    for as I hear, but do not understand,
    so, looking down from hence, I make out nothing.”

    “No other answer give I thee,” he said,
    “save that of action; for a fair request
    ought to be met by deeds without a word.”

    We climbed down from the bridge’s further head,
    where to the eighth embankment it is joined,
    and then the trench was clearly shown to me;
    and in it I beheld a frightful throng
    of snakes, and of so weird a kind, that still
    the memory of them freezes up my blood.

    Let Libya and her sand no longer boast;
    for though she breed chelỳdri, jàculi,
    with cenchri, phàreae and àmphisbaenae,
    ne’er with all Ethiopia did she show,
    nor e’en with what above the Red Sea lies,
    either so many or such evil plagues.
    Among this cruel and most dismal swarm
    people were running, nude and terrified,
    and with no hope of hole or heliotrope.
    Their hands were bound behind their back with snakes,
    whose tail and head were thrust between their loins,
    and tied together in a knot in front.

    Then lo, a serpent hurled himself at one,
    who near our bank was standing, and transfixed him
    there where the neck is to the shoulders joined.
    Never were o or i so quickly written,
    as he took fire, and, burning up, must needs
    turn wholly into ashes as he fell;

    whereat, though thus destroyed upon the ground,
    the dust, assembling of its own accord,
    turned instantly into the self-same man.

    So likewise, as great sages have declared,
    the Phoenix dies, and then is born again,
    as she approaches her five-hundredth year;
    she feeds through life on neither herbs or grain,
    but on amòmum only and incense-tears;
    her final swaddling bands are nard and myrrh.

    And as is he who falls, nor knoweth how,
    by demon force, which pulls him to the ground,
    or other inhibition binding man,
    and who, on getting up again, looks round
    wholly bewildered by the great distress
    which he has felt, and, as he looks, heaves sighs;
    such was that sinner, after he had risen.
    O Power of God, how truly just thou art,
    that in revenge dost deal such blows as these!

    Thereat my Leader asked him who he was,
    and he replied: “Into this wild ravine
    I rained from Tuscany not long ago.
    Mule that I was, a beast’s life, not a man’s,
    I liked; I ’m Vanni Fucci, called the Beast;
    for me Pistoia was a worthy den.”

    Then “Tell him not to slip away,” I said,
    “and ask what fault thrust him down here; for I
    once saw in him a man of blood and strife.”

    The sinner then, who understood, feigned not,
    but turned toward me both mind and face, and said,
    as with a sudden shame he colored up:
    “That thou hast caught me in the misery
    in which thou see’st me, gives me greater pain
    than that which took me from the other life.
    I can’t refuse what thou dost ask of me.
    I ’m placed thus low, because ’t was I who robbed
    the vestry known for its fair ornaments;
    a deed once falsely put upon another.
    But now, lest thou enjoy this sight of me,
    if thou art ever out of these dark lands,
    thine ears to my announcement ope, and hear:
    Pistoia first despoils herself of Neri;
    then Florence changes folk and government.
    From Val di Magra Mars draws forth a bolt
    by turbid clouds enveloped; next, with wild
    and cruel storm, a battle will be fought
    upon the Picene Plain; then suddenly
    the bolt will cleave the mist in such a way,
    that every Bianco will thereby be wounded.
    And this I ’ve said, that it may give thee pain!”

The Seventh Trench. Thieves

    The thief, at the conclusion of his words,
    lifted his hands with both their figs, and cried:
    “Take that, O God, for ’t is to Thee I show them!”

    From that time onward snakes have been my friends,
    for thereupon one coiled around his neck,
    as if to say: “I ’d have thee speak no more;”
    another, coiling, tied his arms together,
    and clinched itself so well in front of him,
    that he could make no use of them at all.

    Pistoia, ah, Pistoia, why not will
    to burn to ashes, and no longer last,
    since in ill-doing thou excell’st thy seed?
    In all of Hell’s dark rings I ’ve seen no spirit
    so arrogant toward God; not even he,
    who fell down headlong from the walls at Thebes.

    Without another word he fled away;
    whereat I saw a Centaur full of rage
    come crying: “Where, where is the stubborn soul?”
    Not ev’n Maremma has so many snakes,
    I think, as on his crupper that one had,
    as far as where our human form begins.

    Upon his shoulders right behind his nape
    there crouched a dragon with wide opened wings;
    and he sets fire to whomsoe’er he meets.

    My Teacher said: “He, yonder, Cacus is,
    who ’neath the rocks that form Mount Aventine
    oft made a lake of blood. He travels not
    along the road o’er which his brethren go,
    because of having fraudulently robbed
    the famous herd which he as neighbor had;
    this ended his sly deeds beneath the club
    of Hercules, who may perhaps have dealt him
    a hundred blows, whereof he felt but ten.”

    While thus he spoke, that sinner, too, made off;
    whereat three spirits came and stood below us,
    whom neither I nor even my Leader noticed,
    until they all cried out: “Who then are ye?”
    because of which our conversation ceased,
    for afterward we heeded them alone.
    I knew them not; but so it happened then,
    as it is wont to do in certain cases,
    that one perforce employed another’s name,
    saying: “But where can Cianfa have remained?”
    Hence, that my Leader might give heed, I placed
    my finger in a line from chin to nose.

    If thou art slow now, Reader, to believe
    what I shall tell, no marvel will it be,
    for I, who saw it, hardly grant I did.

    As toward them I was holding up my brows,
    lo, a six-footed serpent hurls itself
    in front of one, and clings to him all over;
    with both its middle feet it clasped his paunch,
    and with its fore feet seized upon his arms;
    then with its teeth it wounded both his cheeks;
    it spread its hind feet out along his thighs,
    and thrusting next its tail between the two,
    it stretched it upward all along his back.
    Ivy was never rooted to a tree
    so fast, as round about the other’s limbs
    that horrible wild creature twined its own.
    And thereupon, as if hot wax they were,
    they stuck together, and their colors mixed,
    till neither seemed to be what it had been;
    just as a browish hue precedes the flame
    on burning paper which is not yet black,
    while, equally, the white part dies away.

    The other two looked on, and each exclaimed:
    “O me, Agnello, what a change is thine!
    for see, thou now art neither two nor one.”

    Already into one had both heads turned,
    when we two countenances still beheld
    mixed in a single face, where both were lost.
    From the four previous strips two arms were made;
    the thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
    became such members as were never seen.

    Cancelled therein was every former aspect;
    the transformed figure seemed both two and none;
    and thus appearing slowly moved away.

    As like a lightning-flash a lizard looks,
    if, changing hedges ’neath the dog-day’s scourge,
    across a road it passes; even such
    a little fiery serpent seemed to me,
    as toward the bellies of the other two
    it came, livid and black as peppercorn.
    And in that part through which our nourishment
    is first received, it transfixed one of them,
    and then fell down, stretched out in front of him.
    The pierced man gazed at it, but nothing said;
    nay, firmly on his feet he stood, and yawned,
    as if attacked by fever or by sleep.
    He at the serpent looked, and it at him;
    one through his wound, the other through its mouth
    smoked hard, and each smoke with the other mingled.

    Let Lucan, then, be silent, where he tells
    of poor Sabellus’ and Nassidius’ fate,
    and, giving heed, hear what is now proclaimed.
    Of Cadmus, and of Arethusa, too,
    let Ovid cease to speak; for though his verse
    turn him into a snake, and make of her
    a fount, I grudge him not; for face to face
    he ne’er so changed two natures, that the forms
    of each were ready to exchange their matter.

    They blended each with each in such a way
    that, while the serpent fork-wise clove its tail,
    the wounded man together drew his feet.
    The legs and with them ev’n the very thighs
    so stuck together, that in little time
    their juncture left no mark that could be seen.
    The cloven tail was taking on the shape
    which there was being lost; the skin of one,
    meanwhile, was growing soft, and hard the other’s.
    I saw his arms withdraw into his armpits,
    and both the serpent’s feet, which were not long,
    lengthen as much, as those were growing short.
    And then its hinder feet, together twisted,
    became the member which a man conceals,
    while from his own the wretch had two thrust forth.
    And while the smoke was veiling both of them
    with novel hues, and generated hair
    on one side, and deprived of it the other,
    the one stood up, and down the other fell,
    nor turned aside for that the impious eyes,
    beneath which each of them was changing face.
    The one who stood, drew his in toward his temples;
    and from the excessive matter coming there
    ears issued on his undeveloped cheeks;
    and that, which ran not back, but was retained,
    of this superfluous matter, gave the face
    a nose, and thickened suitably its lips.

    He who was lying down thrusts forth his muzzle,
    and backward through his head withdraws his ears,
    even as a snail doth with its horns; his tongue,
    which single used to be, and prompt to speech,
    divides itself, while in the other case,
    the split one closes, and the smoking stops.

    The soul which had become a savage beast
    flees hissing through the trench; the other spits
    behind him as he talks. Then, having turned
    away from him his just created shoulders,
    he to the third said: “I ’d have Buoso run,
    as I have, on his belly o’er this path.”

    I thus beheld the seventh balast change
    and interchange; here let its novelty
    excuse me, if it slightly blur my pen.
    And though somewhat bewildered were my eyes,
    and though confused my mind, those men could not
    escape so secretly, that I should fail
    Pùccio Sciancato perfectly to see;
    and of the three companions who came first,
    he only was not changed; the other one
    was he, for whom, Gavillë, thou dost weep.

    Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
    that thou dost beat thy wings o’er sea and land,
    while ev’n through Hell thy name is spread abroad!
    Among the thieves five such as these I found,
    thy citizens, whence shame accrues to me,
    nor to great honor risest thou thereby.
    But if the truth be dreamed at dawn’s approach,
    thou ’lt feel a little while from now what Prato,
    of others not to speak, is craving for thee;
    and were it now, it would not be too soon;
    so were it, then, since thus it needs must be!
    for it will grieve me more, the more I age.

    We went away, and up the flight of stairs,
    the bournes had formed for our descent before,
    my Teacher climbed again, and drew me with him;
    and as we followed up the lonely path
    among the rocks and boulders of the crag,
    our feet proceeded not without our hands.

    I sorrowed then, and now again I sorrow,
    when I direct my mind to what I saw,
    and curb my genius more than I am wont,

    lest it should run when virtue guides it not;
    that, if a kindly star, or aught that’s better,
    have blest me, I myself may not regret it.

    As many glow-worms as the countryman, —
    who on the hillside takes his rest, when he,
    who lights the world, least hides his face from us,
    while to the gnat the fly is giving way, —
    sees down along the valley where, perchance,
    he gathers in his grapes, or ploughs his field;
    with just as many flames the whole eighth trench
    was gleaming bright, as I perceived at once,
    when I was where its bottom came in view.

    As he who by the bears avenged himself,
    beheld Elijah’s chariot when it left,
    and when to heaven its horses rose erect,
    since he could not so trace it with his eyes,
    as to see more than just the flame alone,
    when like a little cloud it rose on high;
    of such a nature were the flames that moved
    along the gulley of the ditch, for none
    displays its theft, though each a sinner hides.

    Risen up to look, I so stood on the bridge,
    that without being pushed I would have fallen,
    had I not grasped a great projecting rock.
    My Leader, who perceived me thus intent,
    then said: “The spirits are within the fires,
    and each is swathed by that wherewith he burns.”

    “My Teacher,” I replied, “I ’m more assured
    through hearing thee, but deemed it so already,
    and wished to ask thee: ‘Who is in the flame
    which comes along so cloven at the top,
    that from the pyre it seems to rise, whereon
    Etèocles was with his brother placed?’”

    He answered me: “Therein are both Ulysses
    and Diomed tormented, who in pain
    thus go together, as they did in wrath;
    and in that flame of theirs they now bewail
    the ambush of the horse, which made the gate,
    from which the Roman’s noble seed went forth;
    there they lament the trick, because of which
    Deidamìa, dead, still mourns Achilles;
    there the Palladium’s penalty is paid.”

    “If they can speak within those sparks,” said I,
    “I pray thee, Teacher, much, and pray again
    that mine be worth to thee a thousand prayers,
    refuse not my request to linger here
    until the horned flame come this way; thou see’st
    that toward it I ’m inclined by great desire.”

    And he replied to me: “Thy prayer deserves
    much praise and therefore I accede to it,
    but see thou that thy tongue restrain itself.
    Leave speech to me, who have a clear idea
    of what thou wouldst; for they, since Greeks they were,
    might be, perchance, disdainful of thy words.”

    After the flame had come so near to us,
    that time and place seemed fitting to my Leader,
    ’t was in this fashion that I heard him speak:

    “O ye that in a single flame are two,
    if I deserved of you, when still alive,
    if I deserved of you or much or little,
    when in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
    depart not; but let one of you inform us
    whither, when lost, he went away to die.”

    The greater horn then of the ancient flame
    began to quiver with a murmuring sound,
    as would a flame made weary by the wind;
    and then, while swaying here and there its tip,
    as if the latter were the tongue that spoke,
    gave forth a voice, and said: “When I departed
    from Circe, who concealed me near Gaeta
    more than a year before Aeneas so
    had named the place, nor fondness for my son,
    nor pious reverence for my agèd father,
    nor ev’n the bounden love which should have cheered
    Penelope, could overcome within me
    the eagerness I had to gain experience
    both of the world, and of the vice and worth
    of men; but forth I put upon the deep
    and open sea with but a single ship,
    and with that little company, by whom
    I had not been deserted. Both its shores

    I then beheld, as far away as Spain,
    Morocco and the island of the Sards,
    and all the rest that sea bathes round about.
    Both old and slow were I and my companions,
    when we attained that narrow passage-way,
    where Hercules set up those signs of his,
    which warned men not to sail beyond their bounds;
    Seville I left behind me on the right hand,
    Ceuta I’d left already on the other.

    And then I said: ‘O brothers, ye who now
    have through a hundred thousand perils reached
    the West, to this so short a waking-time
    still left your senses, will not to refuse
    experience of that world behind the sun
    which knows not man! Bethink you of the seed
    whence ye have sprung; for ye were not created
    to lead the life of stupid animals,
    but manliness and knowledge to pursue.’

    So eager for the voyage did I make
    my fellows by this little speech of mine,
    that, after it, I hardly could have checked them.
    Hence, to the morning having turned our stern,
    we with our oars made wings for our mad flight,
    e’er veering toward the left as on we sped.
    Night was already seeing all the stars
    of the other pole, and our pole so low down,
    that from the ocean’s floor it never rose.

    Five times rekindled, and as often quenched,
    had been the light beneath the moon, since first
    we entered on the passage of the deep,
    when lo, a mountain loomed before us, dim
    by reason of the distance, and so high
    it seemed to me, that I had seen none such.
    And we rejoiced; but soon our happiness
    was turned to grief; for from the new-found land
    a whirlwind rose, and smote our vessel’s prow;
    three times it made her whirl with all the waters;
    then at the fourth it made her stern go up,
    and prow go down, even as Another pleased,
    till over us the ocean’s waves had closed.”

    The flame, because of having ceased to speak,
    was quiet and erect, and now away from us
    was going with the gentle Poet’s leave;
    when lo, another, which behind it came,
    caused us to turn our eyes up toward its tip,
    by reason of a vague sound issuing thence.

    As the Sicilian bull (which bellowed first
    with the lament of him, and that was right,
    who with his file had given form to it,)
    was wont to bellow with the voice of him
    who suffered in it, so that, though of brass,
    it seemed the one who by the pain was pierced;
    even so, since from the body of the flame
    they had nor path nor mouth, the painful words
    were changed at first into the latter’s tongue.
    But when these words had travelled to the tip,
    and given it that vibration which the tongue,
    when uttered, gave to them, we heard it say:

    “O thou, to whom I now address my voice,
    and who just now didst talk in Lombard, saying:
    ‘Now go thy way, for thee I urge no more;’

    though I, perhaps, have somewhat late arrived,
    be not displeased to stop and speak with me;
    thou see’st that I am not, although I burn!
    If into this blind world thou only now
    art fallen down from that sweet Latin land,
    whence all my guilt I bring, pray tell me whether
    the Romagnoles are having peace or war;
    for I came from the mountains ’tween Urbino
    and that high peak from which the Tiber springs.”

    While downward I was leaning still intent,
    my Leader touched me on my side, and said:
    “Speak thou, for this one an Italian is.”

    And I, who had my answer all prepared,
    began to speak without delay: “O soul,
    that art concealed down yonder, thy Romagna
    is not at present, and she never was,
    devoid of war within her tyrants’ hearts;
    but I left none apparent there just now.
    Ravenna is, as she for many years
    has been; Polenta’s eagle so broods there,
    that Cervia it o’ercovers with its wings.
    The town which made the long resistance once,
    and of the French a sanguinary heap,
    beneath the green paws finds itself again.
    Verrucchio’s former Mastif and the new,
    who foully with Montagna dealt, there make,
    where they are wont, a gimlet of their teeth.

    The cities of Lamone and Santerno
    the little lion of the white lair rules,
    who changes sides from summer-time to winter;
    and that whose flank is by the Savio bathed,
    lives, as it sits twixt plain and mount,
    a free state half, and half a tyranny.
    And now, I pray thee, tell me who thou art,
    nor harder be than others here have been,
    so may thy name maintain itself on earth.”

    After the flame had roared a little while,
    as is its fashion, to and fro it moved
    its pointed tip, and then gave forth this breath:

    “If I believed that my reply were made
    to one who to the world would e’er return,
    this flame would stay without another quiver;
    but inasmuch as, if I hear the truth,
    none e’er returned alive from this abyss,
    fearless of infamy I answer thee.
    A man of arms I was, then Cordelier,
    trusting, since girded thus, to make amends;
    and certainly my trust had been confirmed,
    were ’t not for that High Priest, (whom ill befall!)
    who set me at my former sins again;
    both how and why I ’d have thee hear from me.
    While I was still the shape of bones and flesh
    my mother gave me, my performances
    were not a lion’s, but a fox’s deeds.

    All covert practices and hidden ways
    I knew; and I so carried on their arts,
    that to the ends of earth their fame was noised.
    When I perceived at last that I had reached
    that period of my life, when each should strike
    his sails and coil his ropes, what hitherto
    had given me pleasure I thereat disliked;
    I yielded then, repenting and confessing,
    and that, alas, poor me! would have availed.
    The Prince of modern Pharisees, who then
    hard by the Lateran had a war on hand,
    though not with either Saracens or Jews,
    for Christian were all enemies of his,
    and none of them had gone to conquer Acre,
    or been a merchant in the Soldan’s land;
    not heeding in himself his lofty office
    and holy orders, or in me the cord,
    which leaner used to make those girt therewith;
    but as upon Soracte Constantine
    once bade Sylvester heal his leprosy;
    so this one called on me, as master-leech,
    to cure him of the fever of his pride;
    he asked me for advice, but I kept still,
    because his words were like a drunkard’s words.
    And then he said: ‘Let not thy heart mistrust;
    I from now on absolve thee; teach me, then,
    how I can Palestrina overthrow.

    To lock and unlock Heaven is in my power,
    as thou dost know; two, therefore, are the Keys,
    my predecessor held in small esteem.’
    His weighty words then drove me to the point,
    at which the silent course appeared the worse;
    ‘Father,’ I therefore said, ‘since from the sin
    thou washest me, which I must now commit,
    a promise long drawn out but shortly kept
    will cause thy triumph on the lofty seat.’
    Then Francis came for me, when I was dead;
    but one of our black Cherubs said to him:
    ‘Remove him not, and do no wrong to me!
    Among my menials he must needs descend,
    because he gave the fraudulent advice,
    since which till now I ’ve had him by the hair;
    for who repents not cannot be absolved,
    nor yet can one at once repent and will,
    the contradiction not permitting it!’
    O woeful me! O how I shook with fear,
    when, after laying hold on me, he said:
    ‘Perhaps thou didst not think me a logician!’
    He carried me to Minos, and the latter
    round his hard back eight times entwined his tail,
    and when in great rage he had bitten it,
    ‘A sinner of the thievish fire is this,’
    he said; hence, where thou see’st me, I am lost,
    and, thus robed, sorrowing go my way.”

    When he had thus completed his discourse,
    the flame departed from us with its grief,
    twisting and lashing its sharp-pointed horn.

    I and my Leader then passed further on
    up o’er the crag, as far as the next arch
    which spans the ditch, wherein their due is paid
    to those who burdens win by severing bonds.

    Who ever could, ev’n with unfettered words,
    tell fully of the blood and of the wounds
    which now I saw, though oft he told the tale?
    All tongues would certainly fall short of it,
    by reason of our speech and of our mind,
    whose means are small for taking in so much.

    If all the people should again assemble,
    who on Apulia’s fortune-ravaged soil
    suffered of old from all the loss of blood
    shed by the Trojans, and in that long war,
    which with its spoil of rings made such high heaps,
    as Livy writes, who maketh no mistakes;
    with those who felt the painful force of blows
    received in waging war with Robert Guiscard,
    and those whose bones are still heaped up together
    at Ceperano, where a faithless liar
    was each Apulian, and near Tagliacozzo,
    where old Alardo won, though all unarmed;
    and if, of these, one showed a limb pierced through,
    and one a limb lopped off, ’t would all be nothing,
    compared with this ninth trench’s foul display.

    No cask, indeed, by loss of middle-board
    or stave, is opened as was one I saw,
    split from the chin to where one breaketh wind;
    while down between his legs his entrails hung,
    his pluck appeared, and that disgusting sack,
    which maketh excrement of what is swallowed.

    While I on seeing him was all intent,
    he looked at me, and opening with his hands
    his breast, he said: “See now how I am cloven!
    Behold how torn apart Mahomet is!
    Ali in tears moves on ahead of me,
    cloven in his face from forelock down to chin;
    and all the others whom thou seest here
    disseminators were, when still alive,
    of strife and schism, and hence are cloven thus.
    There is a devil here behind, who thus
    fiercely adorns, and to the sword’s edge puts
    each member of this company anew,
    when we have gone around the woeful road;
    because, ere one return in front of him,
    the wounds thus made have all been closed again.
    But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
    perhaps to put off going to the torture
    adjudged thine accusation of thyself?”

    “Death hath not reached him yet,” replied my Teacher,
    “nor to a torment is he led by guilt,
    but that complete experience may be giv’n him,

    I, who am dead, must needs conduct him here
    from circle unto circle down through Hell;
    and this is true, as that I speak to thee.”

    On hearing him, more were there than a hundred
    who stopped there in the ditch to look at me,
    and who through their surprise forgot their pain.

    “To Fra Dolcino do thou therefore say,
    thou that, perhaps, wilt shortly see the sun,
    if soon he would not hither follow me,
    to arm him so with food, lest stress of snow
    should give the Novarese a victory,
    which else would not be easily obtained.”

    When one foot he had raised to go away,
    Mahomet said these words to me; which done,
    upon the ground he stretched it to depart.

    Another then, who had his neck pierced through,
    his nose cut off as far as ’neath his brows,
    and who had one ear only, having stopped
    to gaze in wonder with the others there,
    opened, before the rest, his throat, whose neck
    vermilion was on every side, and said:

    “O thou that by thy guilt art not condemned,
    and whom up in the Latin land I ’ve seen,
    unless too great resemblance play me false,
    call Pier da Medicina to thy mind,
    if e’er thou see again the lovely plain,
    which from Vercelli slopes to Marcabò.

    And make it known to Fano’s two best men,
    to Messer Guido and Angiolello, too,
    that they, unless foreseeing be in vain
    down here, will from their vessel be cast forth,
    and drowned in sacks near La Cattòlica,
    through a disloyal tyrant’s treachery.
    Between the isles Majolica and Cyprus
    Neptune ne’er saw so great a crime committed
    by pirates, nay, nor by the Argolic folk.
    That traitor who sees only with one eye,
    and holds the town, from seeing which, one now
    is with me here, who fain would fasting be,
    will to a conference have them come with him;
    he ’ll then so act, that ’gainst Focara’s wind
    they ’ll stand in need of neither vow nor prayer.”

    And I to him: “Point out and show to me,
    if news of thee thou ’dst have me bear above,
    which is the one who had the bitter sight.”

    Thereat he laid his hand upon the jaw
    of one of his companions, oped his mouth,
    and cried: “This is the one, for he speaks not;
    when exiled, he removed all doubt in Caesar,
    by saying that a man, when once prepared,
    ne’er brooked delay but to his detriment.”

    Oh, how dismayed that Curio seemed to me,
    who from his throat now had his tongue cut out,
    yet once had been so daring in his speech!

    Then one, from whom both hands had been lopped off,
    raising his maimed arms through the gloomy air,
    so that his blood befouled his face, cried out:
    “Mosca will thou remember, too, who said,
    alas! ‘What ’s done is done!’ a speech which proved
    the seed of evil for the Tuscan race.”
    “And death” I thereto added, “to thy tribe!”
    Then he, as woe on woe he heaped, went off,
    as one would whom his grief had made insane.

    But I remained to look upon the throng,
    and such a thing I saw as I should be
    afraid to tell of without further proof;
    if it were not that conscience reassures me,
    the good companion which, beneath the breastplate
    of conscious purity, emboldens man.
    I really saw, and still I seem to see it,
    a trunk without a head, which moved along,
    as moved the others of the mournful herd;
    and by the hair it held the severed head,
    which, hanging like a lantern from its hand,
    was saying as it gazed at us: “O me!”
    With his own self he made himself a lamp,
    and two in one they were, and one in two;
    how this can be, He knows who so ordains.

    When at the bridge’s very foot he was,
    he raised his arm above him, head and all,
    that he might thus bring near to us his words,

    which were: “Now see my baneful punishment,
    thou that, though breathing, go’st to see the dead!
    See whether any be as great as this!
    And that thou with thee mayst bear news of me,
    know that Bertran de Born I am, the man
    who gave the youthful king the ill support.
    Of sire and son I mutual rebels made;
    Ahithophel by Absalom and David,
    with his malicious goadings, did no more.
    Because I severed those who thus were joined,
    I bear my brain around with me, alas!
    severed from its foundation in this trunk;
    retaliation thus is seen in me.”

    The many people and unheard-of wounds
    had caused my eyes to be so drunk with tears,
    that fain they were to linger there and weep;
    but Virgil said: “At what art gazing still?
    Why is it that thine eyes still rest down there
    among the wretched mutilated shades?
    Thou didst not thus when in the other trenches;
    consider, then, if thou propose to count them,
    that this trench circles two-and-twenty miles,
    and that the moon is now beneath our feet;
    short is the time allowed us still, and more
    there is to see, than what thou seest here.”

    “If thou hadst heeded” I thereat replied,
    “the reason for my gazing there, thou wouldst,
    perhaps, have granted me a longer stay.”

    Meantime my Leader on his way was going,
    and I behind him moving, as I made
    my answer, adding: “In that hollow place,
    whereon I kept mine eyes so steadily,
    I think a spirit sprung from mine own blood
    bewails the fault so dearly paid for there.”

    Thereat my Teacher said: “Let not thy thoughts
    hereafter break on him; heed other things,
    and there let him remain; for at the foot
    of that small bridge I saw him point thee out,
    and with his finger fiercely threaten thee;
    Geri del Bello I then heard him called.
    So wholly wast thou then intent on him
    who formerly possessed Hautefort, that thou,
    till he departed, didst not look beyond.”

    “Leader,” said I, “his death by violence,
    which is not yet avenged for him by any
    who shared the shame, made him indignant; that,
    as I believe, was why he went away
    without addressing me; he thus has caused me
    to pity him the more.” We thus conversed
    till we had reached the first place on the crag,
    whence, had there been more light, the next ravine
    had to its very bottom been revealed.

    When we o’er Malebolgë’s final cloister
    were situated so, that its lay-brethren
    could be perceived by us, uncouth laments,
    which had their arrow-heads with pity barbed,
    so pierced me through and through, that with my hands
    I closed mine ears. Such pain as there would be,
    if from the hospitals of Val di Chiana,
    Maremma and Sardinia, from July
    until September, all diseases came

    together in one ditch; such was it here;
    and out of it there came a stench, like that
    which out of rotting limbs is wont to come.

    Adown the last bank of the lengthy crag
    we went, as ever to the left; and then
    much clearer was my vision toward the bottom,
    wherein the servant of the Most High Lord,
    Justice infallible, is punishing
    the falsifiers she recordeth here.

    I do not think it were a sadder sight
    to see the whole race in Aegina sick,
    when so suffused with poison was the air,
    that all the animals, down to the little worm,
    fell dead, and when the ancient race of people,
    according to what poets hold for truth,
    out of the seed of ants restored themselves;
    than now it was, to see the spirits languish
    down in that gloomy ditch in different heaps.
    One on his belly lay, and others leaned
    against each other’s shoulders, while another
    crawled on all fours along the dismal path.

    Without conversing, step by step we moved,
    both looking at and listening to the sick,
    who could not raise their bodies. Two of these
    I then saw sitting and against each other
    leaning, just as a pan against a pan
    is leaned to warm, and spotted o’er with scabs

    from head to foot; and never have I seen
    a curry-comb plied by a boy, for whom
    his master waited, or by one who kept
    awake against his will, as each oft plied
    upon himself the edge of finger-nails
    for the great rage of itching, which hath else
    no help; their nails kept scraping down their scabs,
    as doth a knife the scales of bream, or fish
    of other kinds equipped with larger scales.

    “O thou that with thy fingers flay’st thyself,”
    to one of them my Leader then began,
    “and who at times dost pincers make of them,
    pray tell us whether Latin any be
    of those in here, so may thy nails
    suffice thee for thy work eternally.”

    “We, both of us, whom thou beholdest here
    so spoiled, are Latin,” answered one who wept,
    “but who art thou that didst inquire of us?”

    My Leader thereupon said: “I am one
    who with this living man from ledge to ledge
    descend, and who propose to show him Hell.”

    Thereat the common back was broken up,
    and trembling each of them turned round toward me,
    with others who had heard him by rebound.
    Then my good Teacher drew close up to me,
    and said: “Say whatsoe’er thou wilt to them.”
    Hence, since he so had wished it, I began:

    “So may your memory never fly away
    from human minds in that first world of ours,
    but rather under many suns survive,
    pray tell me who ye are, and of what people;
    nor let your foul and loathsome punishment
    make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”

    “I of Arezzo was; and Albero
    da Siena had me burned;” one then replied,
    “but what I died for doth not bring me here.
    ’T is true I said to him, although in jest,
    that I knew how to raise me in the air;
    and he, who, curious, had but little sense,
    wished me to show that art to him; and only
    because I did not make him Daedalus,
    he had me burned by one, who treated him
    as son. But to the last trench of the ten
    Minos, who may not make mistakes, condemned me
    for the alchemy I practised in the world.”

    Then to the Poet I: “Now was there ever
    a people as vainglorious as the men
    of Siena? Surely not the French by far!”

    Whereat the other leprous one, who heard me,
    replied to what I said: “Excepting Stricca,
    who moderation knew in what he spent;
    and Niccolò, who was the first to find
    the costly use of cloves in gardens where
    such seed takes root; excepting, too,

    the company, on whom Càccia d’ Asciàn
    wasted his vineyard and great forest land,
    while d’ Abbagliato squandered all his sense.
    But so that thou mayst know who backs thee thus
    against the men of Siena, point thine eyes
    toward me, that well my face may answer thee;
    so shalt thou see that I ’m Capocchio’s shade,
    who metals falsified by alchemy;
    and thou, if well I see thee, shouldst recall
    how good an ape of nature I was once.”

Falsifiers of Persons, Money, and Words

    When Juno, on account of Semele,
    was angry with the royal blood of Thebes,
    as several times she showed herself to be,
    so fiercely mad did Athamas become,
    that, when he saw his wife approaching him,
    burdened by her two sons on either side,
    “Spread we the nets,” he cried, “that I may take,
    upon their passing, lioness and cubs!”
    and thereupon stretched out his cruel claws,
    and taking hold of one, Learchus named,
    whirled him around, and dashed him ’gainst a rock;
    his wife then with the other drowned herself.

    Again, when Fortune so low down had brought
    the Trojans’ arrogant, all-daring power,
    that with their kingdom shattered was their king;
    Hecuba, sad, forlorn, and captive now,
    when she had seen her dead Polỳxena,
    and in her painful anguish had perceived
    her Polydorus lying on the beach,
    out of her senses, barked as would a dog;
    so greatly had her suffering turned her mind.

    But ne’er did furies or of Thebes or Troy
    reveal in any one such cruelty,
    in goading beasts or, much less, human limbs,
    as that which I beheld in two death-pale
    and naked shades, who ran around, and bit,
    as doth a boar, when from the sty let out.
    One reached Capocchio, and so thrust his tusks
    into his neck behind, that, dragging him,
    he made his belly scrape the solid ground.

    The Aretine, still trembling, said to me:
    “That imp is Gianni Schicchi who, enraged,
    goes all around ill-treating others thus.”
    Then “Oh,” said I to him, “so may the other
    not fix his teeth in thee, be not too tired
    to tell me who he is, before he ‘skips’!”

    And he to me: “That is the ancient soul
    of wicked Myrrha, who, outside the bounds
    of lawful love, became her father’s mistress.
    She came to sin with him by counterfeiting
    another’s person in herself, as dared
    the other one who yonder goes away, —
    that he might gain the lady of the stud, —
    to counterfeit Buoso Donati’s self,
    and make his will and give it legal form.”

    When the two furious souls, on whom my eyes
    were fixed, had passed away, I turned them round
    to look upon the other evil born.

    And one I saw, who like a lute were shaped,
    if he had only had his groin cut off
    down in the region where a man is forked.
    The heavy dropsy which unmates the limbs
    in such a way with ill-digested humor,
    that face and paunch no longer correspond,
    was causing him to keep his lips apart,
    as doth the hectic, who, because of thirst,
    turns one lip chinward, and the other up.

    “O ye that are, and wherefore I know not,
    free from all torment in this world of woe,”
    said he to us, “behold, and pay attention
    to Master Adam’s wretched misery!
    When living, I had all that I desired,
    and now, alas, I crave a drop of water.
    The little brooks which toward the Arno run
    down from the Casentino’s green-clad hills,
    and render all their channels cool and fresh,
    are evermore before me, nor in vain;
    because their image makes me drier far
    than this disease, which strips my face of flesh.
    The rigid Justice, which is scourging me,
    takes from the very place in which I sinned
    the means to give my sighs a greater flight.
    There lies Romena, where I falsified
    the coin on which the Baptist’s form is stamped;
    for that I left my body burned above.

    But could I see the woeful soul of Guido,
    or Alexander, or their brother, here,
    for Fonte Branda I ’d not give the sight.
    One is in here already, if the shades,
    who go around here raging, tell the truth,
    but what is that to me whose limbs are bound?
    If only I were still so light of foot,
    that I could in a hundred years advance
    one inch, I ’d be already on the road,
    in search of him among the loathsome people,
    although this trench goes round eleven miles,
    and is no less than half a mile across.
    Through them am I in such a family,
    for they persuaded me to coin the florins,
    which had at least three carats of alloy.”

    Then I to him said: “Who are those two wretches
    who, smoking like wet hands in winter-time,
    are lying there beside thee on thy right?”

    “I found them here,” he answered, “when I rained
    into this ditch, since when they have not turned,
    nor will, I think, for all eternity.
    One is the woman who charged Joseph falsely;
    the other, Sinon, Troy’s deceitful Greek;
    their burning fever makes them reek like this.”

    And one of them, who felt aggrieved, perhaps,
    at being named so darkly, smote the speaker
    upon his hard stiff belly with his fist.

    It made a sound, as it had been a drum;
    then Master Adam smote him with his arm,
    which did not seem less hard, upon his face,
    and said: “Though I of motion be deprived,
    by reason of my limbs which heavy are,
    I have an arm that ’s loose for needs like this.”

    Then he replied: “When going to the fire
    thou hadst it not so ready; but just so,
    and more, thou hadst it, when thou madest coin.”

    He of the dropsy: “Here thou sayest true,
    but thou wast not so true a witness there,
    where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”

    “If I spoke falsely, thou didst falsify
    the coin!” said Sinon, “I ’m for one sin here,
    and thou for more than any other demon!”

    “Remember, perjurer, the horse,” replied
    he of the swollen paunch, “and bitter be
    for thee, that known it is by all the world!”

    “Ill be for thee the thirst wherewith thy tongue
    is cracking,” said the Greek, “and that foul water,
    which ’fore thine eyes thus makes thy paunch a hedge!”

    Thereat the coiner said: “As is its wont,
    thy mouth in speaking evil gapeth wide;
    for though I ’m thirsty, and humor stuffs me out,
    thine is the fever and the aching head;
    and thou ’dst not stand in need of many words
    bidding thee lick the mirror of Narcissus.”

    On listening to them I was all intent,
    when “Now be careful there!” my Teacher said,
    “for I ’m not far from quarrelling with thee.”

    When I thus heard him speak to me in anger,
    such was the shame wherewith I turned to him,
    that through my memory it is circling still;
    and such as he who dreameth of his harm,
    and, dreaming, wishes that he dreamt, and thus,
    as if it were not, longs for that which is;
    such I became, who, impotent to speak,
    would fain excuse myself, and all the while
    was doing so, but did not think I was.

    “Less shame would wash away a greater fault
    than thine hath been;” my Teacher said to me,
    “therefore unburden thee of all thy sadness,
    and count on me as ever at thy side,
    if it again should chance that Fortune find thee
    where folk in such a wrangle are engaged;
    for vulgar is the wish to hear such things.”

INFERNO XXXI

The Edge of the Central Well

The Giants

    One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
    so that it colored both my cheeks, and then
    supplied me with the medicine required;
    Achilles’ and his father’s lance, I hear,
    was likewise wont to be the source of, first,
    a sad, and, after, of a grateful gift.

    We turned our backs upon the woeful vale
    over the bank which girds it round about,
    and passed across without a single word.

    Here less than night it was, and less than day,
    so that my sight advanced not far; but here
    I heard a horn give forth so loud a sound,
    that it had rendered any thunder faint;
    this led mine eyes, as counter to its path
    they followed, wholly to a single place.

    After the woeful rout, when Charlemagne
    the holy army of his knights had lost,
    Roland blew not so terrible a blast.

    I had not kept my head turned toward it long,
    when many lofty towers I seemed to see;
    I, therefore: “Teacher, say what town is this?”

    “Since through the darkness from too far away
    thou peerest,” he replied, “it comes about
    that afterward thou errest in conceiving.
    If yonder thou attain, thou ’lt clearly see
    how from afar one’s senses are deceived;
    hence onward urge thyself a little more.”

    Thereat he took my hand with kindly care,
    and said to me: “Ere further on we go,
    so that the fact may seem less strange to thee,
    know, then, that towers they are not, but Giants;
    and all of them are standing in the well
    around the bank, each from his navel down.”

    As, when a fog is thinning off, one’s gaze
    little by little giveth shape to that,
    which, since it packs the air, the mist conceals;
    even so, as through the dense, dark air I pierced,
    and nearer drew and nearer to the brink,
    error in me took flight, and fear increased;
    for, as upon its round enclosing walls
    Montereggione crowns itself with towers;
    thus o’er the margin which surrounds the well
    with one half of their bodies towered up
    those frightful Giants, whom, when from the sky
    he thunders, Jupiter is threatening still.

    Already now was I distinguishing
    the face of one, his shoulders and his breast,
    most of his paunch, and, down his sides, both arms.

    When Nature ceased from making animals
    like these, and took such executioners
    from Mars, she certainly did very well;
    and ev’n if she of elephants and whales
    repent her not, whoever subtly looks
    holds her therein the more discreet and just;
    for where the reasoning faculty is joined
    to evil will equipped with power to act,
    people can make against it no defence.

    His face appeared to me as long and big
    as is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,
    and in proportion to it were his other bones;
    so that the bank, which from his middle down
    an apron was, showed quite so much of him
    above it, that of reaching to his hair
    three Frisians would have made a useless boast;
    for I full thirty spans of him perceived,
    down from the place at which one buckles cloaks.

    “Rafel mai amech zabi et almi”
    the frightful mouth, to which no sweeter psalms
    were fitting, thereupon began to cry.

    Then toward him cried my Leader: “Foolish soul,
    keep to thy horn, and vent thyself therewith,
    when wrath or other passion seizes thee!
    Search at thy neck, and thou wilt find the cord
    which holds it tied, O spirit of confusion,
    and see it lying on thy mighty breast.”

    To me then: “Self-accused he stands, for this
    is Nimrod, to whose evil thought is due
    that more than one tongue in the world is spoken.
    Let us leave him alone, nor talk in vain;
    for such is every tongue to him, as his
    to others is, for that is known to none.

    Then, turning to the left, we travelled on
    much further; and within a crossbow’s shot
    we found the next one far more large and fierce.
    What was the master’s power who girded him,
    I cannot say; but this one had in front
    his left arm, and behind his back his right,
    tied by a chain, which downward from his neck
    held him so bound, that on the uncovered part
    it wound around as far as the fifth coil.

    My Leader said to me: “’Gainst Jove Most High
    this proud soul wished to test his strength, and hence
    hath this reward. Ephialtes is his name;
    his haughty undertaking he attempted
    what time the Giants caused the Gods to fear;
    the arms he plied he moveth now no more.”

    And I to him: “If possible it be,
    I ’d gladly have these eyes of mine enjoy
    experience of the measureless Briareus.”

    Then he replied: “Antaeus thou ’lt behold
    not far from here, who speaks, and, since unbound,
    can set us at the bottom of all sin.

    He is much further on, whom thou wouldst see,
    and bound he is, and shaped like this one, save
    that more ferocious in his looks he seems.”

    There never was an earthquake strong enough
    to shake a tower with so much violence,
    as Ephialtes quickly shook at this.
    Then more than ever yet did I fear death,
    nor for it was there need of more than fear,
    had it not been that I perceived his bonds.

    We thereupon proceeded further still,
    and to Antaeus came, who full five ells,
    beside his head, protruded from the pit.

    “O thou that in the valley fortune-blest,
    which once caused Scipio to inherit glory
    when with his followers Hannibal took flight,
    once tookst a thousand lions as thy prey,
    and who, hadst thou been at thy brethren’s war
    on high, it seems that it is still believed
    the Sons of Earth had been the victors there;
    pray set us down below, nor let disdain
    affect thee, where the cold locks up Cocytus.
    Make us not go to Tìtyus or to Tìpheus;
    this man can give what most is longed for here;
    stoop, then, nor twist thy muzzle. He can still
    give fame to thee on earth, since he is living,
    and still looks forward to long life, if Grace
    recall him not untimely to itself.”

    The Teacher thus; then he in haste stretched out
    the hands, whose mighty pressure Hercules
    once felt, and took my Leader. Virgil then,
    on feeling himself taken, said to me:
    “Come here, that I may take thee up;” and then
    so did, that he and I one bundle were.

    Such as the Carisenda seems, when viewed
    beneath its leaning side, whene’er a cloud
    sails o’er it so, that opposite it hangs;
    such did Antaeus seem to me, who watched
    to see him stoop, and such a moment ’t was,
    that I had gladly gone another road.

    But lightly at the bottom, which devours
    Judas and Lucifer, he set us down;
    nor, thus bent over, did he linger there,
    but raised himself, as on a ship a mast.

INFERNO XXXII

The Ninth Circle. Treachery. Cocytus

Traitors to their Relatives, and to their Country

    If I had rhymes that were as harsh and hoarse
    as would be fitting for the dismal hole,
    on which lean all the other circling rocks,
    I ’d squeeze the juice of my conception out
    more fully; but because I have them not,
    not without fear do I resolve to speak;
    for to describe the bottom of the universe
    is not an enterprise wherewith to jest,
    nor for a tongue that says ‘mamma’ and ‘dad’;
    let, then, those Ladies give my verse their aid,
    who helped Amphion build the walls of Thebes,
    that from the facts the telling differ not.

    O rabble, that, ill-born beyond all people,
    are in a place, to speak of which is hard,
    far better had ye here been sheep or goats!

    When we were down within the gloomy well,
    beneath the Giant’s feet, though lower far,
    and I still gazing at its lofty wall,
    I heard one say to me: “Look where thou walkest!
    and see that with thy feet thou trample not
    the heads of us two wretched, weary brothers!”

    Thereat I turned around, and saw before me,
    and ’neath my feet, a lake which, being frozen,
    seemed to be made of glass and not of water.

    The Danube up in Austria never made
    so thick a veil in winter for its course,
    nor yonder ’neath the cold sky did the Don,
    as what was here; for even if Tambernich
    had fallen on it, or had Pietrapana,
    it had not cracked even at its very edge.

    And as a frog remains, to do its croaking,
    with muzzle out of water, in the season
    when oft the peasant dreams that she is gleaning;
    even so, as far as where one’s shame is shown,
    the woeful shades were livid in the ice,
    as to the notes of storks they set their teeth.
    Each kept his face turned downward; from his mouth,
    the cold, and from his eyes, his saddened heart
    provides itself a witness in their midst.

    When I had gazed around a while, I looked
    down at my feet, and two I saw with heads
    so close together, that their hair was mixed.

    “Ye that are pressing thus your breasts together,
    say who ye are,” said I. They bent their necks,
    and when their faces had been raised toward me,
    their eyes, moist only inwardly before,
    gushed upward though the lids; whereat the cold,
    binding the tears between them, closed them up.

    A clamp ne’er bound so tightly board to board;
    whereat, so great the anger mastering them,
    like two he-goats, they butted one another.

    And one who had, by reason of the cold,
    lost both his ears, with face still lowered, said:
    “Why dost thou mirror thee so much on us?
    If thou wouldst know who those two near thee are,
    the valley from which thy Bisenzio flows
    belonged to their sire Albert and to them.
    They issued from one body; and thou canst search
    through all Caìna, but thou ’lt never find
    a shade more worthy to be fixed in ice;
    not he, whose breast and shadow broken were
    by one same blow at Arthur’s hand; nor yet
    Focaccia; nor this fellow here, whose head
    so blocks me, that I cannot see beyond,
    and who was Sàssol Mascheroni called;
    who he was, thou, if Tuscan, now knowst well.
    And that thou put me to no further speech,
    know, then, that I was Camiciòn de’ Pazzi,
    and that, to excuse me, I await Carlìn.”

    Thereafter I beheld a thousand faces
    made doglike by the cold; hence frozen ponds
    cause me to shudder now, and always will.

    And now, while toward that center we were moving,
    whereto all heavy objects gravitate,
    and I was trembling in the eternal cold;

    I know not whether it were will, or fate,
    or chance; but as I walked among the heads,
    hard in the face of one I struck my foot.
    Weeping he scolded: “Wherefore dost thou smite me?
    Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
    for Mont’ Aperti, why dost thou molest me?”

    And I said: “Teacher, wait now for me here,
    that I through him may issue from a doubt;
    then at thy pleasure shalt thou hurry me.”

    My Leader stopped; and I to him, who still
    was savagely blaspheming, said: “What sort
    of man art thou, that scoldest people so?”

    “Now who art thou, that goest” he replied,
    “through Antenora, smiting cheeks so roughly,
    that it would be too much, wert thou alive?”

    “I am alive, and it may profit thee”
    was my reply, “for me to place thy name,
    if fame thou ask, among my other notes.”

    And he: “I crave the contrary; away
    with thee, and bother me no more; for ill
    dost thou know how to flatter in this bog!”

    Thereat I seized him by the nape, and said:
    “It needs must be that thou reveal thy name,
    or that no hair remain upon thee here!”

    Then he to me: “Though thou pull out my hair,
    I ’ll neither say, nor show thee, who I am,
    fall thou upon my head a thousand times.”

    I had his hair wrapped round my hand already,
    and more than one shock had I plucked from him,
    while he was barking, with his eyes turned down;
    when here another cried: “What ails thee, Bocca?
    Is making noise with jawbones not enough,
    unless thou bark? What devil touches thee?”

    “Henceforth” said I, “I would not have thee speak,
    perfidious traitor; for true news of thee
    I ’ll carry with me to thy lasting shame.”

    “Begone, and tell whate’er thou wilt;” he answered,
    but be not silent, if thou issue hence,
    of him who had just now his tongue so ready.
    He here bewails the money of the French;
    ‘Him of Duera’ thou canst say, ‘I saw
    where cold the days are for the sinful folk.’
    And if thou shouldst be asked who else was there,
    thou hast beside thee him of Beccherìa,
    who had his gorget cut in two by Florence.
    Gianni de’ Soldanier is further on,
    I think, with Ganellon, and Tebaldello,
    who, while its people slept, unlocked Faenza.”

    From him we had departed now, when two
    I saw, so frozen in a single hole,
    that one man’s head served as the other’s cap.
    And as because of hunger bread is eaten,
    even so the upper on the other set
    his teeth, where to the nape the brain is joined.

    Not otherwise did Tydeus gnaw the temples
    of Menalippus out of spite, than this one
    was gnawing at the skull and other parts.

    “O thou that showest by a sign so beastly
    hatred toward him thou eatest, tell me why,”
    said I to him, “on this express condition,
    that shouldst thou rightfully of him complain,
    I, knowing who ye are, and that one’s sin,
    may quit thee for it in the world above,
    if that, wherewith I speak, be not dried up.”

INFERNO XXXIII

The Ninth Circle. Treachery. Cocytus

Traitors to their Country, and to their Guests

    From his grim meal that sinner raised his mouth,
    and wiped it on the hair of that same head,
    which he had spoiled behind. He then began:

    “Thou wouldst that I renew a hopeless grief,
    the thought of which already breaks my heart,
    before I speak of it. But if my words
    are likely to be seeds, and bear the fruit
    of infamy upon the traitor whom I gnaw,
    speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.

    I know not who thou art, nor by what means
    thou ’rt come down here, but when I hear thee speak,
    thou truly seemst to me a Florentine.
    Know, then, that I Count Ugolino was,
    and this man here Ruggieri, the Archbishop;
    and now I ’ll tell thee why I ’m thus his neighbor.

    That, as the outcome of his evil thoughts,
    I, trusting him, was seized, and afterward
    was put to death, there is no need to say;
    but that which thou canst not have heard, that is,
    how cruel was my death, thou now shalt hear,
    and whether he have wronged me thou shalt know.

    A narrow slit within the moulting-tower,
    which bears, because of me, the name of Hunger,
    and in whose walls still others must be locked,
    had through its opening shown me many a moon
    already, when I had the evil dream,
    which rent apart the curtain of the future.
    This one therein a lord and huntsman seemed,
    chasing the wolf and wolfings toward the mount
    which hinders Pisans from beholding Lucca,
    with bitches lean and eager and well trained;
    for he had set before him in his van
    Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi.
    After a little run both father and sons
    seemed weary to me; then methought I saw
    their flanks torn open by sharp-pointed fangs.

    When, just before the morning, I awoke,
    I heard my children, who were with me there,
    sob in their sleep, and ask me for their bread.
    Cruel indeed thou art, if, thinking what
    my heart forebode, thou grievest not already;
    and if thou weepest not, at what art wont
    to weep? Awake they were, and now the hour
    was drawing nigh when food was brought to us,
    hence each, by reason of his dream, was worried;
    and then I heard the dread tower’s lower door
    nailed up; whereat, without a word, I looked
    my children in the face. I did not weep,

    so like a stone had I become within;
    they wept; and my poor little Anselm said:
    ‘Father, thou lookest so! What aileth thee?’
    But still I did not weep, nor did I answer
    through all that day, or through the following night,
    till on the world another sun had dawned.
    Then, when a little beam had made its way
    into our woeful prison, and I perceived
    by their four faces, how I looked myself,
    I bit in anguish both my hands. And they,
    thinking it done because I craved to eat,
    immediately stood up, and said to me:
    ‘Father, much less shall we be pained, if us
    thou eat; thou with this wretched flesh didst clothe us,
    do thou, then, strip it from us now.’ Thereat,
    to sadden them no more, I calmed myself;
    through that day and the next we all kept mute.
    Ah, why, hard earth, didst thou not open up?

    Then Gaddo, when the fourth day we had reached,
    stretched himself out at length before my feet,
    and said: “My father, why dost thou not help me?”
    And there he died; and, ev’n as thou seest me,
    between the fifth day and the sixth I saw
    the three fall one by one; and, blind already,
    I gave myself to groping over each,
    and two days called them, after they were dead;
    then fasting proved more powerful than pain.”

    When he had spoken thus, with eyes awry,
    he seized again the wretched skull with teeth,
    which for the bone were strong as are a dog’s.

    Ah, Pisa, foul reproach of those that dwell
    in that fair country where the sì is heard;
    since slow thy neighbors are to punish thee,
    then let Caprara and Gorgona move,
    and make a hedge across the Arno’s mouth,
    that every person in thee may be drowned!
    for though Count Ugolino had the name
    of traitor to thee in thy castle-towns,
    thou shouldst not thus have crucified his sons.
    Their youthful age had made, thou modern Thebes,
    Brigata and Uguccione innocent,
    and the other two my canto names above.

    Further along we went, to where the ice
    roughly enswathes another class of people,
    not downward turned, but wholly on their backs.
    Weeping itself allows not weeping there,
    and tears, which find a barrier in their eyes,
    turn back, to cause their suffering to increase;
    because the first ones form a solid block,
    and thus like crystal visors wholly fill
    the hollow cup beneath the brow. And though,
    as in a callous spot,
    because of cold
    all feeling had departed from my face,

    it seemed to me that now I felt some wind;
    whence I to him: “My Teacher, who moves this?
    Is not all moving air quenched here below?”

    And he: “Ere long shalt thou be where thine eyes,
    seeing the cause which raineth down the blast,
    will make an answer to thee as to this.”

    One of the wretches of the icy crust
    called out to us thereat: “O souls, so cruel,
    that unto you the last place is assigned,
    remove for me the hard veils on my face,
    that I may somewhat vent the pain that fills
    my heart, before the tears freeze up again.”

    Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee,
    say who thou art; and should I not relieve thee,
    may I needs reach the bottom of the ice!”

    Then he: “I Frate Alberigo am,
    he of the evil garden’s fruit, who here
    for every fig I gave get back a date.”

    Then “Oh!” said I, “art thou already dead?”
    And he to me replied: “I have no knowledge
    how in the world above my body fares.
    Such is the privilege of this Ptolomèa,
    that frequently a soul falls into it,
    ere Atropos have caused it to move on.
    But that thou scrape more gladly from my face
    these glassy tears, know, then, that just as soon
    as any soul betrays, as I betrayed,

    its body is taken from it by a demon,
    who then takes charge of it, until its time
    be all revolved. Into a well like this
    it rushes headlong down; and so, perhaps,
    the body of the shade that winters here
    behind me, is still visible above.
    This thou shouldst know, if just come down, for he
    Ser Branca d’ Oria is, and many years
    have now gone by, since he was thus shut up.”

    “I think” said I, “that thou deceivest me,
    for Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,
    but eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and dons his clothes.”

    “Above us, in the Malebranche’s ditch,”
    he said, “there, where the sticky pitch is boiling,
    not yet had Michel Zanche’s soul arrived,
    when in his stead this fellow left behind
    a devil in his body, as did also
    one of his kinsmen, who with him performed
    the treachery. But stretch thy hand here now,
    and ope mine eyes!” And yet I oped them not,
    for rudeness shown to him was courtesy.

    Ah, Genoese! ye men estranged from all
    morality, and full of every vice,
    why from the earth are ye not wholly driven?
    for with the meanest spirit of Romagna,
    I found one such of you, that, for his deeds,
    in soul he bathes already in Cocytus,
    and seems in body still alive above.

INFERNO XXXIV

The Ninth Circle. Treachery. Cocytus

Traitors to their Benefactors. Lucifer

    “The banners of the King of Hell advance
    toward us; now, therefore, look ahead of thee,”
    my Teacher said, “and see if thou perceive him.”

    As, when a heavy fog is breathed abroad,
    or when at night our hemisphere grows dark,
    a windmill looks when seen from far away;
    even such a structure seemed I now to see;
    then, for the wind, I shrank behind my Leader,
    for other shelter was there none. I now —
    and ’t is with fear I put it into verse, —
    was where the shades were wholly covered up,
    and visible as is a straw in glass;
    some lying are; and some are standing up,
    one on his head, the other on his soles;
    one, like a bow, bends toward his feet his face.

    When we had gone so far ahead, that now
    it pleased my Teacher to reveal to me
    the Creature who once seemed so beautiful,
    he stepped from where he was in front of me,
    stopped me, and said: “Lo Dis, and lo the place,
    where thou must arm thyself with fortitude!”

    How frozen and how weak I then became,
    ask thou not, Reader, for I write it not,
    because all speech would be of small avail.
    I did not die, nor yet remained alive;
    think for thyself now, hast thou any wit,
    what I became, of both of these deprived.

    The Emperor of the Realm of Woe stood forth
    out of the ice from midway up his breast;
    and I compare more closely with a Giant,
    than merely with his arms the Giants do;
    consider now how great that whole must be,
    that with such parts as these may be compared.
    If, once as beautiful as ugly now,
    he still raised up his brows against his Maker,
    justly doth every woe proceed from him.

    Oh, what a marvel it appeared to me,
    when I beheld three faces to his head!
    One was in front of us, and that was red;
    the other two were to the latter joined
    right o’er the middle of each shoulder-blade,
    and met each other where he had his crest;
    that on the right twixt white and yellow seemed;
    the left one such to look at, as are those
    who come from there, where valeward flows the Nile.
    Under each face two mighty wings stretched out,
    of size proportioned to so huge a bird;
    sails of the sea I never saw so large.

    They had no feathers, but were like a bat’s
    in fashion; these he flapped in such a way,
    that three winds issued forth from him; thereby
    Cocytus was completely frozen up.
    With six eyes he was weeping, and his tears
    and bloody slaver trickled o’er three chins.
    In each mouth, as a heckle would have done,
    a sinner he was crushing with his teeth,
    and thus was causing pain to three of them.
    To him who was in front of us the biting
    was nothing to the clawing, for at times
    his back remained completely stripped of skin.

    “That soul up there which hath the greatest pain
    Judas Iscariot is,” my Teacher said,
    “who hath his head within, and plies his legs
    without. Of the other two, whose heads are down,
    Brutus is he who from the black snout hangs;
    see how he writhes, and utters not a word!
    Cassius the other is, who so big-limbed
    appears. But night is coming up again,
    and now ’t is time to leave, for we ’ve seen all.”

    Then, as it pleased him, I embraced his neck,
    and he availed himself of time and place,
    and when the wings were opened wide enough,
    he firmly grasped the shaggy flanks, and then
    from tuft to tuft he afterward descended
    between the matted hair and frozen crusts.

    When we were come to where the thigh turns round,
    just at the thick part of the hips, my Leader
    with tiring effort and with stress of breath
    turned his head round to where his legs had been,
    and seized the hair as one would who ascends;
    hence I thought we were going back to Hell.

    “Hold fast to me, for by such stairs as these”
    panting like one worn out, my Teacher said,
    “must such great wickedness be left behind.”
    Then, through an opening in the rock he issued,
    and, after seating me upon its edge,
    over toward me advanced his cautious step.

    Raising mine eyes, I thought that I should still
    see Lucifer the same as when I left him;
    but I beheld him with his legs held up.
    And thereupon, if I became perplexed,
    let those dull people think, who do not see
    what kind of point that was which I had passed.

    “Stand up” my Teacher said, “upon thy feet!
    the way is long and difficult the road,
    and now to middle-tierce the sun returns.”

    It was no palace hallway where we were,
    but just a natural passage under ground,
    which had a wretched floor and lack of light.

    “Before I tear myself from this abyss,
    Teacher,” said I on rising, “talk to me
    a little, and correct my wrong ideas.

    Where is the ice? And how is this one fixed
    thus upside down? And in so short a time
    how hath the sun from evening crossed to morn?”

    Then he to me: “Thou thinkest thou art still
    beyond the center where I seized the hair
    of that bad Worm who perforates the world.
    While I was going down, thou wast beyond it;
    but when I turned, thou then didst pass the point
    to which all weights are drawn on every side;
    thou now art come beneath the hemisphere
    opposed to that the great dry land o’ercovers,
    and ’neath whose zenith was destroyed the Man,
    who without sinfulness was born and died;
    thy feet thou hast upon the little sphere,
    which forms the other surface of Judecca.
    ’T is morning here, whenever evening there;
    and he who made our ladder with his hair,
    is still fixed fast, ev’n as he was before.

    He fell on this side out of Heaven; whereat,
    the land, which hitherto was spread out here,
    through fear of him made of the sea a veil,
    and came into our hemisphere; perhaps
    to flee from him, what is on this side seen
    left the place empty here, and upward rushed.”

    There is a place down there, as far removed
    from Beelzebub, as e’er his tomb extends,
    not known by sight, but by a brooklet’s sound,

    which flows down through a hole there in the rock,
    gnawed in it by the water’s spiral course,
    which slightly slopes. My Leader then, and I,
    in order to regain the world of light,
    entered upon that dark and hidden path;
    and, without caring for repose, went up,
    he going on ahead, and I behind,
    till through a rounded opening I beheld
    some of the lovely things the sky contains;
    thence we came out, and saw again the stars.



PURGATORIO I

Introduction to the Purgatorio

The Shore of the Island of Purgatory. Cato

    To run o’er better water hoists her sails
    the little vessel of my genius now,
    which leaves behind her such a cruel sea;
    and of that second Realm I ’ll sing, wherein
    the human spirit purifies itself,
    and groweth worthy to ascend to Heaven.

    But here let Poetry arise from death,
    since, holy Muses, yours I am; and let
    Calliopë, here somewhat higher soaring,
    with those sweet tones accompany my song,
    whose power the miserable Magpies felt
    so keenly, that of pardon they despaired.

    The oriental sapphire’s tender hue,
    now gathering in the sky’s unclouded face,
    as far as to the first of circles pure,
    began again to give mine eyes delight,
    when forth I issued from the deadly air,
    which with its gloom had filled mine eyes and heart.
    The beauteous planet which incites to love,
    veiling with light the Fishes in her train,
    was causing all the eastern sky to laugh.

    Round to the right I turned, and set my mind
    upon the other pole, and saw four stars,
    never perceived, save by the first of men.
    The sky appeared to enjoy their little flames.
    O region of the North, that widowed art,
    because deprived of gazing thereupon!

    When I had from the sight of them withdrawn,
    turning a little toward the other pole,
    whence now the Wain had wholly disappeared,
    a lone Old Man beside me I perceived,
    deserving of such reverence in his looks,
    that no son owes his father any more.
    Long was the beard he wore, and partly white,
    as likewise was the hair upon his head,
    two locks of which hung down upon his breast.
    And so the rays of those four holy stars
    adorned his face with splendor, that to me course
    he looked as if the sun were facing him.

    “Who, then, are ye, that ’gainst the blind stream’s
    have from the eternal Prison escaped?” he said,
    moving the while those venerable locks.
    “Who led you, or what served you as a lamp,
    when forth ye issued from the night profound,
    which makes the infernal Vale forever black?
    Are broken thus the laws of Hell’s abyss,
    or through new counsel is there change in Heaven,
    that ye, though damned, are come to these my cliffs?”

    My Leader thereupon took hold of me,
    and with his words and with his hands and signs
    imposed respect upon my legs and brow.

    He then replied: “I came not of myself;
    from Heaven came down a Lady, at whose prayer
    I helped this man with my companionship.
    But since thy will it is that our true state
    should be explained to thee more clearly, mine
    it cannot be that this should be denied thee.
    Not yet hath this man his last evening seen;
    but through his folly was so near to it,
    that he was left but very little time.
    As I have told thee, I was sent to save
    his life; nor was there any other way
    than this, to which I have addressed myself.
    I ’ve shown him all the people who are guilty;
    and now I mean those spirits to reveal,
    who ’neath thy jurisdiction cleanse themselves.
    Long would it take to tell thee how I led him;
    virtue descendeth from on high, which helps me
    lead him to see thee and to hear thee speak.
    His coming, therefore, please to welcome; Freedom
    he seeks, which is so dear, as knoweth he
    who gives up life therefor. This thou dost know,
    since death for its sake was not bitter to thee
    in Utica, where thou didst leave the robe,
    which on the Great Day will so brightly shine.

    The eternal edicts are not void through us;
    for this man lives, and I ’m not bound by Minos;
    but of that circle am, wherein the eyes
    of thy chaste Marcia are, O holy breast,
    whose looks implore thee still to hold her thine;
    for love of her, then, yield thee unto us!
    Permit us through thy seven domains to go.
    My grateful praise of thee I ’ll bear to her,
    if to be mentioned there below thou deign.”

    “Marcia so pleased mine eyes,” he then replied,
    “that, while upon the other side I was,
    I granted all the favors she desired.
    Now that she dwells beyond the evil stream,
    no longer can she move me, by the law
    made at the moment when I issued thence.
    But if a Lady of Heaven impel and guide thee,
    as thou hast said, no need of flattering prayers;
    suffice it thee that for her sake thou ask.
    Go, then, and see that with a leafless rush
    thou gird this man, and that thou wash his face,
    so that therefrom all foulness thou remove;
    for ’t were not fit he went, with eyes o’ercast
    by any mist, before the first of those
    who serve as Ministers of Paradise.
    This little isle around its lowest base,
    down yonder where the waves are beating it,
    produces rushes on its yielding ooze.

    No other plant, like one that brought forth leaves,
    or hardened, can maintain its life down there,
    because it yields not when receiving blows.
    Thereafter be not hither your return;
    the sun, which rises now, will show you how
    to climb the Mountain by the easiest slope.”

    Thereat he disappeared; and I arose
    without a word, and to my Leader’s side
    I closely drew, and toward him turned mine eyes.
    And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;
    let us turn backward, for the shore slopes down
    on this side toward its lowly boundaries.”

    The dawn was vanquishing the morning breeze,
    which fled before it, so that, from afar,
    I recognized the shimmering of the sea.

    We now were going o’er the lonely plain,
    as one who to a road he lost returns,
    and, till he find it, seems to go in vain.
    When we were there, where with the sun the dew
    still struggles on, through being in a place
    where, for the breeze, it slowly melts away,
    my Teacher, having spread out both his hands,
    rested them gently on the tender grass;
    whence I, who of his purpose was aware,
    yielded to him the cheeks my tears had stained;
    he then brought all that natural color back,
    which Hell had on my countenance concealed.

    We came thereafter to that lonely shore,
    which never saw its waters sailed by one
    who afterward experienced a return.
    Here, as the other pleased, he girded me.
    O wondrous sight! For, like the humble plant
    which he had chosen, another instantly
    sprang forth again from where he tore the first.

PURGATORIO II

The Shore of the Island of Purgatory

The Angel Pilot and Arriving Souls

    And now already had the sun arrived
    at that horizon, whose meridian circle
    rests with its zenith o’er Jerusalem;
    and Night, which circles opposite thereto,
    was issuing from the Ganges with the Scales,
    which, when she gains, are falling from her hands;
    so that the white and pure vermilion cheeks
    of beautiful Aurora, where I was,
    were turning orange through excessive age.

    Along the seaside we were lingering still,
    like folk who, taking thought about their road,
    go on in heart, but with their body stay;
    when lo, as, at the approach of morning, Mars,
    because of heavy vapors, groweth red
    down in the West above the ocean’s floor;
    even so I saw — may I again behold it! —
    a light which o’er the sea so swiftly moved,
    that no flight is as rapid as its motion;
    from which when I a moment had withdrawn
    mine eyes, to ask a question of my Leader,
    again I saw it grown more bright and large.

    And on each side of it there then appeared
    I knew not what white thing, and underneath
    little by little came another forth.

    Meanwhile my Teacher uttered not a word
    until the first white objects looked like wings;
    then, having recognized the Pilot well,
    he cried: “See, see now that thou bend thy knees!
    This is God’s Angel; fold thy hands! Henceforth
    shalt thou behold such officers as this.
    See how he so scorns human instruments,
    as to wish neither oar, nor other sail
    than his own wings, between such distant shores!
    See how he holds them straight up toward the sky,
    stroking the air with those eternal plumes,
    which do not moult as mortal feathers do!”

    And then, as more and more the Bird divine
    drew near to us, the brighter he appeared;
    therefore mine eyes endured him not near by,
    but down I cast them; with a little boat
    he came ashore, so agile and so light,
    the water swallowed up no part of it.
    Such on its stern the heavenly Pilot stood,
    that he would bless one, were he but described;
    more than a hundred spirits sat within.

    “When Israel out of Egypt came,” they all
    in unison were singing there together,
    with what is written after in that psalm.

    Then, having signed them with the holy Cross,
    whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,
    he went away as swiftly as he came.

    The crowd which stayed seemed strangers to the place,
    and gazed around them there, as doth a man,
    who with unwonted things acquaints himself.

    The sun, which from the middle of the sky
    had hunted Capricorn with arrows bright,
    was shooting forth the day on every side,
    when those new people raised their brows toward us,
    and said: “If ye know how, point out to us
    the road that one should take to reach the Mount.”

    And Virgil answered: “Ye, perchance, believe
    that we have had experience of this place;
    but we are pilgrim-strangers like yourselves.
    We came just now, a little while before you,
    but by another way, so rough and hard,
    that going up will now seem play to us.”

    The souls who, by my breathing, had become
    aware that I was still a living being,
    in their astonishment turned death-like pale;
    and as around a messenger who bears
    the olive, people surge to hear the news,
    and, as to crowding, none of them seem shy;
    so one and all those fortune-favored souls
    fixed on my face their gaze, as if forgetting
    to go and make their spirits beautiful.

    Then one among them I beheld advance,
    in such a loving manner, to embrace me,
    that it persuaded me to do the like.
    O, save in your appearance, empty shades!
    Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,
    and to my breast therewith as oft returned.

    With wonder, I believe, I painted me;
    smiling because of this, the shade drew back,
    while, following after, I pressed further on.
    With gentle words he told me to desist;
    then who it was I knew, and begged of him
    to stop a little while and speak with me.

    “As thee I loved, when in my mortal body,”
    he answered me, “even so, when freed, I love thee;
    therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”

    “Casella mine,” said I, “I take this journey,
    that where I am I may return again;
    but why from thee hath so much time been taken?”

    And he to me: “No outrage hath been done me,
    if he, who takes both when and whom he likes,
    hath more than once refused me passage here;
    for to a Righteous Will is his conformed;
    yet peacefully, these three months, hath he taken
    whoever wished to enter into his boat.
    Hence I, who now was toward the sea-shore bent,
    where Tiber’s water mingles with the salt,
    was with benignity received by him

    at yonder river’s mouth, toward which his wings
    ev’n now are turned; for those who go not down
    toward Acheron, always assemble there.”

    And I: “If some new law take not from thee
    the memory or the practice of the song
    of love, which used to quiet all my longings,
    be pleased a little to console therewith
    my spirit, which, because of coming here
    when in its body, is so sore distressed!”

    “The love that talketh with me in my mind,”
    he thereupon began to sing so sweetly,
    that still within me is its sweetness heard.

    My Teacher, I, and those that with him were,
    seemed as contented, as if none of us
    had any other thing upon his mind.
    Absorbed in listening to his notes, we all
    were motionless; when lo, the grave Old Man,
    who cried: “Ye laggard spirits, what is this?
    What means this negligence and standing still?
    Run to the Mount, and strip ye off the slough,
    which lets not God be visible to you.”

    Ev’n as, when picking grains of wheat or tares,
    doves, met together at their feeding, calm,
    and not displaying their accustomed pride,
    if anything appear that frightens them,
    all of a sudden leave their food alone,
    because assailed by greater cause for care;

    even so I saw that new-come family
    give up the song, and toward the hillside move,
    like one who goes, but whither knoweth not;
    nor was in less haste our departure made.

PURGATORIO III

Antepurgatory

The Repentant who died Excommunicated

    Although their sudden flight had scattered them
    over the plain, and turned them toward the Mount,
    where Justice probes us with its penalties,
    more closely to my faithful mate I drew.
    And how without him had I run my race,
    or who had drawn me up the Mountain’s side?

    To me he seemed o’erwhelmed with self-reproach.
    O conscience, when both dignified and clear,
    how sharp a bite a slight fault is to thee!

    When once his feet had given up the haste,
    which of their dignity deprives all acts,
    my mind, to one thought limited at first,
    enlarged its scope with eager interest now;
    and toward that Mountain I addressed my gaze,
    which skyward rises highest from the sea.

    The sun, which back of us was flaming red,
    in front of me was broken in the shape
    wherein I lent its rays a resting place.
    I turned, and at my side I looked, afraid
    of having been abandoned, when I saw
    the ground was dark in front of me alone.

    When wholly turned, my Comforter began:
    “Why still distrustful? Dost thou not believe
    that I am with thee, and am guiding thee?
    ’T is evening now where buried lies the body,
    wherein I cast a shadow; Naples now
    possesses it; from Brindisi ’t was taken.
    If, then, in front of me no shadow fall,
    marvel no more than at the heavenly spheres
    thou wouldst, which hinder not each other’s rays.
    That Power enables bodies such as mine
    to suffer torments, both of heat and cold,
    which wills not that Its ways be shown to us.
    Insane is he that hopes our human reason
    will ever travel o’er the boundless path,
    o’er which One Substance in three Persons moves.
    Be satisfied, O human race, with facts;
    for if ye could have seen the cause of all,
    no need had been for Mary to bear child;
    and ye ’ve seen, vainly longing, men so great,
    that their desire would else have been appeased,
    which giv’n them is for an eternal grief;
    I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,
    and many others.” Here he bowed his head,
    and, saying nothing more, remained disturbed.

    Meanwhile we had attained the Mountain’s foot;
    and there we found the rocky cliff so steep,
    that legs would there be nimble all in vain.

    ’Tween Lèrici and Turbìa the loneliest
    and wildest path is, if compared with that,
    a safely climbed and easy flight of stairs.

    “Now who knows on which side the hill so slopes,”
    then said my Teacher, as he stayed his steps,
    “that he who wingless goes can make the ascent?”

    Meanwhile, as he was questioning his mind
    about the path, and held his face bowed down,
    and I was gazing upward round the cliff,
    upon my left a throng of souls appeared,
    who toward us moved their feet, yet did not seem
    to move, so slowly were they coming on.

    “Teacher,” said I, “lift up thine eyes; behold
    on this side people who will give us counsel,
    if thou canst not obtain it from thyself.”

    He then looked up, and with relief replied:
    “Let us go toward them, for they slowly come,
    and thou, sweet son, be steadfast in thy hope.”

    Those people were as yet as far away,
    after a thousand of our steps, I mean,
    as a good thrower’s hand would reach, when all
    pressed up against the lofty bank’s hard mass,
    and stayed there, still, and huddled up together,
    as, when in doubt, a walker stops to look.

    Virgil began: “O ye whose end was good,
    O now elected spirits, by the peace
    which I believe ye all look forward to,

    say where the Mount so lies, that going up
    be possible for us; for loss of time,
    to him who knoweth most, is most displeasing.”

    As from the fold young sheep are wont to come
    by ones, and twos, and threes, while timidly
    the others stay, with downcast eyes and muzzle;
    and what the first one doth, so do the rest,
    all huddling up to her, in case she stop,
    simple and quiet, nor yet knowing why;
    even so the leader of that favored flock
    I saw start forward then, and toward us come,
    modest in face and dignified in gait.

    When those who were in front the light beheld
    so broken on the ground upon my right,
    that ’gainst the cliff a shadow fell from me,
    they stopped, and backward drew a little way;
    and all the others coming on behind,
    not knowing why they did so, did the same.

    “Without your asking I affirm to you
    that this you see a human body is;
    therefore the sun’s light on the ground is broken.
    Be not surprised, then, but believe that not
    without a power that cometh down from Heaven,
    is he attempting to surmount this wall.”

    My Teacher thus; those worthy people then,
    as with the back part of their hands they waved,
    said: “Turn, then, and ahead of us go in.”

    And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,
    as thus thou goest, turn thy face! Recall
    if thou hast ever seen me in the world.”

    Toward him I turned, and on him fixed my gaze.
    Blond, handsome, and of noble mien he was,
    although an eyebrow by a blow was cut.

    When I had with due modesty disclaimed
    having e’er seen him there, he said: “Now see!”
    and showed me high upon his breast a wound.
    Then with a smile he said: “Manfred am I,
    the grandson of the Empress Constance; hence
    I beg thee that, on thy return, thou go
    to my fair daughter, mother of the honor
    of Sicily and Aragon, and should
    aught else be told her, tell her thou the truth.

    After my body by two mortal stabs
    had been pierced through, in tears I gave myself
    to that One who forgiveth willingly.
    My sins were horrible, indeed; and yet
    the Goodness Infinite hath arms so wide,
    that It receiveth all who turn to It.
    And if Cosenza’s Pastor, who by Clement
    was sent to hunt me down, had then perused
    this page in God’s book, as he should have done,
    my body’s bones would still be lying there,
    hard by the bridge’s head near Benevento,
    under the keeping of the heavy cairn.

    Bathed by the rain, the wind now blows them round
    outside the Kingdom, near the Verde’s banks,
    whither he moved them with extinguished lights.

    Not by their cursing is Eternal Love
    so lost, that it can not return again,
    as long as hope hath still a speck of green.

    ’T is true that he that dieth in contempt
    of Holy Church, though at the very last
    he may repent, outside this Mountain’s bank
    must stay, for all the time that he hath been
    in his presumption, thirty times as long,
    unless by good prayers shortened be this ban.

    See now if thou canst make me glad, by telling
    my good Costanza both where thou hast seen me
    and of this interdict; for one is here
    greatly advanced by those that are beyond.”

PURGATORIO IV

Antepurgatory. The First Ledge

Those who Neglected Repentance until Death

    Whene’er, because of pleasure or of pain
    received by any faculty of ours,
    our soul is wholly centered thereupon,
    it seems to heed no other faculty;
    and this is ’gainst that wrong belief which holds
    that one soul in us o’er another burns.
    Therefore, when anything is heard or seen,
    which toward it holds the soul intently turned,
    time passes by, and one perceives it not;
    since one thing is the faculty which harks,
    and that which holdeth all the soul another;
    this last is bound, as ’t were, the former free.

    Of this I real experience had, while hearing
    and wondering at that spirit; for the sun
    had climbed up fifty full degrees at least,
    though I had not perceived it, when we came
    to where those souls cried out to us together:
    “The place which you were asking for is here.”

    Oft doth a farmer, when the grapes grow dark,
    close up a wider opening in a hedge
    with but a little forkful of his thorns,

    than was the entrance there, through which my Leader,
    and I behind him, mounted all alone,
    when once the crowd had gone away from us.

    One climbs Sanlèo, and descends to Noli;
    one wins the summit of Bismàntova,
    helped solely by one’s feet; but one up here
    would have to fly; with the swift wings, I mean,
    and plumes of great desire, behind the Guide,
    who gave me hope and furnished me with light.

    As up within the cloven rock we climbed,
    its walls on each side closely hemmed us in,
    while under us the ground both feet and hands
    required. When on the high cliff’s upper edge
    we were, and out upon the open slope,
    “Which way, my Teacher, shall we go?” said I.

    And he to me: “Take thou no backward step;
    keep gaining ground behind me up the Mount,
    until some guide who knows appear to us.”

    So high the summit was, that it surpassed
    our sight, and steeper far the slope, than were
    a line from center to mid-quadrant drawn.

    Weary was I, when I began to speak:
    “O gentle Father, turn around, and see
    how I remain alone, unless thou stop!”

    “Draw thyself up, my son, as far as there!”
    he said, and somewhat higher pointed out
    a ledge on that side circling all the hill.

    His words so spurred me, that I forced myself
    to crawl behind him on my hands and knees,
    until the girding ledge was ’neath my feet.

    There both of us sat down, and faced the East,
    whence we had made the ascent; for looking back
    upon a traversed course is wont to help.
    First to the shores below I turned mine eyes;
    then raised them to the sun, and was amazed
    that we were smitten by it on our left.
    The Poet well perceived that I was gazing
    dumbfounded at the chariot of the light,
    which now was rising ’tween the North and us.

    “If Castor” said he then to me, “and Pollux
    were in the company of yonder mirror,
    which up and down in turn conducts its light,
    thou wouldst the Zodiac’s ruddy part behold
    revolving still more closely to the Bears,
    unless it issued from its ancient path.
    If thou wouldst understand how this can be,
    collect thy thoughts within thee, and imagine
    both Zion and this Mount so placed on earth,
    that both of them one sole horizon have,
    and different hemispheres; and thou wilt see
    how that the road which Phaëthon could not take,
    alas for him, must pass this Mount on one,
    while passing that one on the other side,
    if thine intelligence but clearly heed.”

    “Surely, my Teacher, never have I seen”
    said I, “as clearly as I now perceive,
    where once my mind appeared to be at fault,
    how the mid-circle of supernal motion,
    which in a certain art is called Equator,
    and ever ’tween the sun and winter stays,
    lies toward the North, for reasons giv’n by thee,
    as far on this side as the Hebrew people
    ever beheld it toward the heated parts.
    But, if it please thee, I would gladly know
    how far we have to go; because the Mount
    higher ascends than eyes of mine can rise.”

    “Such is this Mountain” said he then to me,
    “that, always hard to climb at first below,
    it pains one less, the higher one ascends.
    Hence, when so pleasant to thee it shall seem,
    that going up shall be to thee as easy
    as floating with the current in a boat,
    thou then shalt have attained this pathway’s end.
    Hope there to rest thee from thy breathless toil!
    No more I answer; this I know for truth.”

    When he had ended what he had to say,
    the voice of one near by cried out: “Perhaps,
    ere that shall happen, thou wilt need to sit!”

    On hearing this, we both of us turned round,
    and saw a massive boulder on our left,
    which neither I nor he had seen before.

    Thither we drew; and there some persons were,
    who lingered in the shade behind the rock,
    as one is wont to do through indolence.
    And one of them, who weary seemed to me,
    was sitting with his arms around his knees,
    and down between the latter held his face.

    “O my sweet Lord,” said I then, “turn thine eyes
    on yonder man, who shows himself to be
    more lazy than if sloth his sister were!”

    Then turning round toward us, and giving heed,
    he moved his face no more than o’er his thigh,
    and said: “Go up now, thou that active art!”

    I then knew who it was; nor did the strain,
    which quickened still my breath a little, hinder
    my going to him; yet, when at his side
    I was, he barely raised his head, and said:
    “Hast thou at last seen why it is the sun
    driveth his car o’er thy left shoulder here?”

    His lazy actions and his few short words
    impelled my lips to smile a little; then,
    “Belacqua,” I began, “I grieve for thee
    no more; but tell me why thou sittest here?
    Art waiting for a guide, or hast thou now
    merely resumed thy customary mood?”

    And he: “What, brother, is the use of climbing?
    The Bird of God who at the Gate is seated,
    would not allow me to approach the pangs.

    The sky must first turn round me here outside,
    as long as ever in my life it did,
    since I delayed good sighs until the end,
    unless before then I be helped by prayers
    arising from a heart that lives in grace;
    of what avail are those unheard in Heaven?”

    But now the Poet, climbing on ahead,
    was saying: “Come now on with me! Thou see’st
    that our meridian by the sun is touched,
    and that already from the Ganges’ banks
    Night covers up Morocco with her feet.”

PURGATORIO V

Antepurgatory. The Second Ledge

The Negligent who died by Violence

    Already had I parted from those shades,
    and in my Leader’s steps was following on,
    when one behind me, pointing with his finger,
    cried out: “See how the light seems not to shine
    upon the left side of that lower man,
    who seems to act like one that’s still alive!”

    Hearing this speech, I turned mine eyes, and saw
    that with astonishment they gazed at me,
    at me alone, and at the broken light.

    “Why is thy mind so sore perplexed,” then said
    my Teacher, “that thou slackenest thy pace?
    What carest thou for what is whispered here?
    Follow thou me, and let the people talk!
    Firm as a tower remain, which never shakes
    its top, however hard the winds may blow!
    For from himself he ever turns his mark,
    in whom one thought wells up behind another,
    for each of them impairs the other’s strength.”

    What could I say in answer, save “I come”?
    And this I said, tinged slightly with the color
    which sometimes makes one worthy of forgiveness.

    Meanwhile a little way ahead of us
    some people crosswise o’er the slope were coming,
    singing the Miserere verse by verse.
    When they became aware that through my body
    I gave no passage to the rays of light,
    they changed their chant into a long, hoarse “Oh!”
    and two of them, acting as messengers,
    ran out to meet us, and enquiring said:
    “Cause us to know what kind of life is yours.”

    My Teacher answered: “Ye may go your way,
    and unto those that sent you out report
    that real flesh this man’s body is. And if,
    as I suppose, they stopped because they saw
    his shadow, they ’ve been answered well enough;
    if they respect him, it may profit them.”

    I never saw ignited vapors cleave
    at nightfall an unclouded sky, or break
    so rapidly from August clouds at sunset,
    that these returned not up in shorter time;
    and, once there, with the rest they veered toward us,
    as would a troop that ran without a curb.

    “These people who are crowding us are many,”
    the Poet said, “and come to beg of thee;
    therefore go on, and listen on thy way.”

    “O soul, that goest to be glad” they cried,
    as on they came, “with those limbs which thou hadst
    when thou wast born, a little stay thy steps!

    Recall if thou hast e’er seen one of us,
    that yonder thou mayst carry news of him!
    Why, pray, dost thou go on? Ah, why not stop?
    We all were slain of old by violence,
    and sinners were until our latest hour;
    then light from Heaven so caused us to beware,
    that we, repentant and forgiving, issued
    from life at peace with God, who in our hearts
    stirs us with grievous longings to behold Him.”

    And I: “Howe’er I gaze upon your faces,
    none do I recognize; and yet, if aught
    within my power can please you, well-born souls,
    ask it, and I will do it, by the peace,
    which, following the feet of such a Guide,
    hath now become my quest from world to world.”

    And one began: “Each trusts in thy good help
    without an oath, provided lack of power
    cut not thy good will short. Hence I, who speak
    alone before the others, beg of thee,
    if e’er thou see the country which extends
    between Romagna and the land of Charles,
    be courteous to me with thy prayers in Fano,
    that supplications due be made for me,
    to help me purge away my grievous sins.
    It was from there I came; but those deep wounds,
    whence flowed the blood wherein my life resided,
    were giv’n me in the Antenori’s lap,

    where I had trusted I should be most safe.
    The lord of Esti, who was angry with me
    beyond the bounds of justice, had it done.
    Yet toward La Mira had I only fled,
    when at Oriàgo I was overtaken,
    still yonder would I be, where people breathe.
    Toward the lagoon I ran, whose reeds and mire
    so hampered me, I fell; and there a pool
    formed from my veins I saw upon the ground.”

    Then said another: “So may that desire,
    which draws thee to the lofty Mount be granted,
    with kindly pity, prithee, help thou mine!
    I Montefeltro was, I am Buonconte;
    Giovanna cares not for me, nor do others;
    hence among these I go with head bowed down.

    And I to him: “What force was it, or chance,
    caused thee to stray so far from Campaldino,
    that never hath thy burial-place been known?”

    “Oh!” he replied, “A river called Archiàno
    flows crosswise at the Casentino’s foot,
    and takes its rise among the Apennines,
    above the Hermitage. There, where its name
    is lost, I came, a fugitive on foot,
    pierced through the throat, and staining with my blood
    the plain. And there it was I lost my sight,
    and ended speech with Mary’s name; and there
    I fell, and all alone my flesh remained.

    The truth I tell, tell thou among the living.
    God’s Angel took me, while the one from Hell
    cried out: ‘Why dost thou rob me, thou from Heaven?
    Thou bearest hence this man’s eternal part,
    because of one small tear which takes him from me;
    but I shall with the rest deal otherwise!’
    Well knowst thou how damp vapors in the air,
    as soon as they ascend to where the cold
    affects them, into water change again.
    He joined that wicked will, which asks for naught
    but evil, with intelligence, and stirred
    the mists and wind, by power his nature gave.
    The valley thereupon, when day was spent,
    he covered o’er with fog from Pratomagno
    up to the mountain-chain, and made the sky
    so lowering o’er it, that the pregnant air
    to water turned; the rain poured down, and what
    the soil absorbed not, reached the rivulets;
    then, having joined the torrent-brooks, it rushed
    so swiftly toward the royal stream, that naught
    could hold it back. The swift Archiàno then
    hard by its outlet found my frozen body;
    and, as it swept it on into the Arno,
    loosened the cross which with my arms I made
    upon my breast, when sorrow’s pain o’erwhelmed me;
    along its banks and bed it rolled me on;
    then covered me, and wrapped me with its spoils.”

    “Prithee, when to the world thou hast returned,
    and when from thy long journey thou art rested,”
    after the second spirit said the third,
    “do thou remember me, who Pia am!
    Sièna made me; Maremma me unmade;
    he knoweth what this means, who previously
    had, in betrothal, ringed me with his gem.”

PURGATORIO VI

Antepurgatory. The Negligent who died by Violence

Address to Italy and Florence

    Whene’er a game of dice is broken up,
    the one who loses sorrowing stays behind,
    and learns, as sadly he repeats the throws;
    while with the other all the people leave;
    one goes before, one grasps him from behind,
    and at his side one asks to be remembered.
    And he stops not, but that one heeds and this;
    the one whose hand he takes no longer crowds;
    and from the throng he thus defends himself.
    E’en such as he, was I in that dense crowd;
    for as I this and that way turned my face,
    and promised each, I freed myself therefrom.

    Here was the Aretine who met his death
    from Ghin di Tacco’s cruel arms, and he,
    who running madly in pursuit was drowned;
    here Frederick Novello prayed with hands
    outstretched, and he of Pisa, who induced
    worthy Marzucco to reveal his strength.
    Count Orso I beheld here, and the soul
    through spite and envy from its body parted,
    and not, so he maintained, through crime committed;

    Pierre de la Brosse, I mean; and here, while still
    on earth, let Brabant’s Lady see to it,
    that ’mong the worse flock she be not for this.

    When I was free from each and all those shades,
    who only prayed that others pray for them,
    that their becoming holy might be sped,
    “It seems that thou deniest,” I began,
    “O thou my Light, expressly in a text,
    that prayer can cause a change in Heaven’s decrees;
    and yet these people only pray for this;
    could it then be, that this their hope is vain,
    or is thy saying not quite clear to me?”

    And he to me: “That which I wrote is clear,
    nor yet delusive is this people’s hope,
    if it be looked at with a healthy mind;
    for Justice stoops not from her lofty height,
    because Love’s ardor all at once fulfils
    what he who dwelleth here must satisfy;
    and there where I decided on this point,
    the fault was not made good again by praying,
    because the prayer discordant was with God.
    Yet in so deep a doubt decide thou not,
    unless She bid thee do so, who a light
    shall be between thine intellect and truth.
    I know not if thou understand; I speak
    of Beatrice; thou ’lt see her up above,
    smiling and happy, on this Mountain’s top.”

    And I: “Let ’s go, then, Lord, with greater haste;
    for now I grow not weary as before;
    and see, the hillside casts its shadow now.”

    “We shall go forward with this day,” he answered,
    “as long as we are able; but the case
    is otherwise than what thou deemest it.
    Ere thou shalt be up there, thou him shalt see
    return, who now so shields him with the hill,
    that thou dost not compel his rays to break.
    But yonder see a soul who all alone
    is seated, and toward us is looking now;
    he will point out to us the quickest way.”

    We came to him. O Lombard soul, how full
    of self-respect and noble scorn thou wast,
    and in the moving of thine eyes how slow
    and dignified! Naught did he say to us;
    but let us go our way, and only gazed
    as would a couching lion in repose.

    Virgil, meanwhile, drew near to him, and begged
    that he would show to us the best ascent;
    and he to his request made no reply,
    but asked us of our country and condition;
    and my kind Leader was with “Mantua . . .”
    beginning, when the self-collected shade,
    from where he was, sprang up to meet him, saying:
    “O Mantuan, I ’m Sordello, of thy town!”
    and each the other thereupon embraced.

    Ah, Italy, thou slave, thou inn of woe,
    ship without pilot in a mighty storm,
    not queen of provinces, but house of shame!
    So instant ready was that noble soul,
    but at the sweet sound of his city’s name,
    to welcome here his fellow citizen;
    and yet within thee now, thy living sons
    are not exempt from war, and those one wall
    and moat enclose upon each other prey!
    All round thy coast-line search its shores, poor wretch,
    and then within thy bosom look, and learn
    if any part of thee be blest with peace.
    What boots it that Justinian rearranged
    thy bridle, if thy saddle vacant be?
    Had it not been for that, thy shame were less.

    And ye, ah, ye, that ought to be devout,
    and so let Caesar in his saddle sit,
    if well ye heeded God’s advice to you,
    behold how wild this animal has grown,
    through being uncorrected by the spur,
    since ye first set your hands upon her rein!

    O German Albert, thou that dost forsake
    this creature now become untamed and wild,
    and oughtest to bestride her saddle-bows,
    may some just judgment from the stars befall
    thy blood, and may it so unheard of be,
    and plain, that it may frighten thy successor!

    For, held by greed of lands outside its bounds,
    thou and thy father also have allowed
    the Empire’s Garden to become a waste.
    Come see the Montagues and Capulets,
    Monaldi and Filipeschi, careless man,
    already troubled those, and these in dread!
    Come, come, thou cruel man, and see the oppression
    of thy nobility, and right their wrongs;
    and thou shalt see how safe is Santafior!
    Come see thy Rome, that, widowed and alone,
    is shedding tears, and day and night is calling:
    “Why dost thou not, my Caesar, stay with me?”
    Come see the people, how they love each other!
    And if for us no pity move thy soul,
    come, then, and shame thee for thine own renown!
    And, if I be allowed, O Jove Supreme,
    Thou that for us wast crucified on earth,
    are Thy just eyes, too, turned away elsewhere?
    Or in Thy counsel’s depths art Thou in this
    a preparation making for some good,
    from our perception utterly cut off?
    For all Italia’s towns are full of tyrants,
    and a Marcellus every churl is deemed,
    who comes to play a party henchman’s rôle.

    My Florence, well mayst thou be satisfied
    with this digression, which concerns thee not,
    thanks to thy people, who look out for that!

    Many at heart are just, but slow to shoot,
    lest to the bow uncounselled they should come;
    but thy folk on their lips alone are just!
    Many refuse to bear the common burden;
    but thy folk eagerly respond, and cry,
    although uncalled: “I ’ll load myself therewith!”
    Be joyful, then, since thou hast cause to be;
    thou that art rich, that peaceful art, and wise!
    Whether I speak the truth, results conceal not.
    Athens and Lacedaemon, they that framed
    the ancient laws, and were so civilized,
    in living well made but a little mark
    compared with thee, that dost so carefully
    provide thee, that thy fine October spinning
    as far as mid-November reaches not.
    How many times, within thy memory,
    hast thou changed laws and coinage, offices
    and customs, and thy membership renewed!
    And if thou well recall and face the light,
    thou ’lt see thy likeness to a suffering woman,
    who on a feather-bed can find no rest,
    but seeks, by tossing, to relieve her pain.

    After their words of greeting, dignified
    and glad, had three and four times been repeated,
    Sordello, drawing back, said: “Who are ye?”

    “Or ever yet the spirits, who deserved
    to rise to God, were toward this Mount directed,
    my bones were buried by Octavian’s order.
    Virgil am I; and through no other guilt
    did I lose Heaven, than through not having faith.”
    ’T was thus my Leader thereupon replied.

    Like one who sudden sees before him aught
    he wonders at, and, as he says: “It is . . .”
    and “No, it ’s not,” believes and disbelieves;
    such did the former seem; and then his head
    he bowed, and, humbly turning back to him,
    embraced him where inferior men take hold.

    “O glory of the Latins,” said he then,
    “through whom our language showed what it could do,
    eternal honor of my native town,
    what merit, or what grace shows thee to me?
    Tell me, if I deserve to hear thy words,
    if thou from Hell art come, and from what cloister.”

    “Through all the circles of the woeful Realm”
    he answered him, “have I come hither; virtue
    from Heaven impelled me, and therewith I come.
    ’T was not for doing aught, but for not doing,
    I lost the sight of that exalted Sun
    thou longest for, and which was known by me
    too late. There is a place below, not sad
    because of pain, but only gloom, where moans
    sound not as wailings, but are merely sighs.
    There with those little innocents I dwell,
    who, not delivered yet from human guilt,
    were bitten by the teeth of death; and there
    with those I dwell, who did not clothe themselves
    with the three holy virtues, but who knew
    the others without vice, and practiced all.
    But give us, if thou know and can, some sign,
    whereby the sooner we may reach the place,
    where Purgatory hath its real beginning.”

    “No fixed place is assigned us;” he replied,
    “I may go upward and around; I ’ll join thee,
    and be thy guide as far as I can go.
    But see already how the day declines,
    and one at night can not ascend; it, hence,
    were well to think of some fair resting place.
    Here to the right are souls that dwell apart;
    if thou permit me, I will lead thee to them,
    and not without delight will they be known.”

    “How, then, is this?” was answered, “Should one wish
    to mount by night, would some one hinder him?
    Or would one not ascend, through lack of power?

    Then with his finger good Sordello marked
    the ground, and: “See!” he said, “When once the sun
    is gone, thou couldst not even cross this line;
    though not because aught else than gloom of night
    would hinder one from climbing; that it is
    puzzles the will with impotence. One could,
    however, downward go again therewith,
    and walking o’er the hillside, wander round
    while still the horizon kept the day confined.”

    My Lord then said, as if in wonder lost:
    “Do thou, then, lead us thither, where thou saidst
    that one while waiting can enjoy himself.”

    But little had we gone away from there,
    when I perceived the hill was hollowed out,
    as here on earth our hillside valleys are.

    “Thither,” that shade said, “we ’ll betake ourselves
    where of itself the hillside forms a lap;
    and there will we await the coming day.”

    A winding path there was, nor steep nor level,
    which led us to a border of the dell,
    where more than half away the hillside falls.
    Gold and fine silver, scarlet and white lead,
    indigo blue, wood’s clear and shining brown,
    and green of emeralds when newly flaked,

    would each in hue be vanquished by the grass
    and flowers found growing in that bosomed dell,
    as by the greater vanquished is the less.
    Nature not only had been painting there;
    but with the fragrance of a thousand scents
    was making up a blend unknown on earth.
    Here, seated on the grass among the flowers,
    “Salve, Regina” singing, souls I saw,
    who, for the dell, could not be seen outside.

    “Before the waning sunlight nest itself,”
    began the Mantuan who had guided us,
    “desire me not to lead you among these.
    Much better from this border shall ye learn
    to know the acts and faces of them all,
    than greeted ’mong them in the dale below.

    The one that sitteth highest up, and seems
    to have neglected what he should have done,
    and with his mouth joins not the others’ songs,
    was Emperor Rudolph, he who might have healed
    the wounds that so have left Italia dead,
    that by another she reviveth late.

    He who appears to cheer him, ruled the land,
    where rise the waters which the Moldau gives
    the Elbe, and the Elbe gives the sea.
    Named Ottocar, he was, in swaddling clothes,
    far better than is Wenceslaus, his son,
    on whom, a bearded man, feed lust and ease.

    That small-nosed man, who close in counsel seems
    with him that hath so kind a countenance,
    died fleeing, and disflowering the Lily.
    Look at him, yonder, how he smites his breast!
    And see the other one, who for his cheek
    hath, sighing, made a cushion of his hand.
    Father and father-in-law of France’s bane,
    they know the latter’s foul and vicious life;
    hence comes the sorrow that so pierces them.

    The one who so large-limbed appears, and joins
    in song with him who hath the manly nose,
    was girded with the cord of every worth;
    and if the youth, who seated is behind him,
    had, following after him, remained as king,
    worth would, indeed, have gone from vase to vase;
    which of the other heirs can not be said.
    The kingdoms James and Frederick hold; but none
    is owner of the better heritage.

    Seldom doth human righteousness ascend
    among the branches; this is willed by Him
    who gives it, that of Him it may be asked.

    My words concern the large-nosed man no less
    than the other, Peter, who is singing with him,
    whence both Apulia and Provence are grieved.
    That plant is as inferior to its seed,
    as of her husband Constance still vaunts more
    than Beatrice and Margaret do of theirs.

    Behold the king, known for his simple life,
    Henry of England, seated there alone;
    he in his branches better issue hath.

    He that among them lower on the ground
    is sitting, and looks up, is Marquis William,
    for whom both Alexandria and her war
    make Montferràt and Canavèsë weep.”

PURGATORIO VIII

Antepurgatory. The Vale of Flowers

Princes intent on Earthly Glory. The Serpent

    ’T was now the hour, which homeward turns the longing,
    and melts the heart of those that sail the sea,
    the day they ’ve said goodbye to tender friends;
    and thrills with love the pilgrim newly sped,
    if from afar he hear a tolling bell,
    that seems to mourn the slowly dying day;
    when I began to render hearing vain,
    and of those souls watch one who, risen up,
    was asking for attention with his hand.
    He joined his palms, and raising them on high,
    turned toward the East his eyes with steadfast gaze,
    as if to God he said: “I heed naught else.”

    “Ere daylight fadeth” issued from his mouth
    with such devoutness, and with notes so sweet,
    that I was made unmindful of myself.
    Thereat the others, sweetly and devoutly
    followed that soul, and sang the whole hymn through,
    fixing their gaze upon the spheres above.

    Sharpen thine eyes here, Reader, for the truth;
    for now its veil is certainly so thin,
    that easy is the passage into it.

    I saw that army of the gentle-born
    gazing on high in silence after this,
    as if in expectation, pale and meek;
    and, issuing from above, and coming down,
    two Angels with two fiery swords I saw,
    which, broken off, were of their points deprived.
    As green they were, as little new-born leaves,
    and clothed with garments which, behind them trailed,
    were stroked and fanned by verdant plumes. One came
    and poised somewhat above us, while the other
    alighted on the hillside opposite,
    so that the people there remained between.
    I well perceived that golden was their hair;
    but on their faces vision went astray,
    as would a power confounded by excess.

    “From Mary’s bosom both of them are come”
    Sordello said, “to guard this sheltered vale
    against the Serpent, which will soon arrive.”

    Hence I, who knew not by what path, turned round,
    chilled through with fear, and to the trusted shoulders
    drew closely back. Sordello thereupon
    began: “And now among the mighty shades
    let us descend, and we will speak with them;
    greatly will they be pleased to see you here.”

    Only three steps, I think, did I go down,
    and was below; then one I saw, who looked
    at me alone, as if he wished to know me.

    The air had for some time been growing dark
    but not so much as, ’tween his eyes and mine,
    not to reveal what it concealed before.
    Toward me he came, and I toward him advanced.
    Noble Judge Nino, when I saw that not
    among the damned thou wast, how glad I was!
    No greetings fair were left unsaid between us;
    and then he asked: “How long ago didst thou
    o’er the far waters reach the Mountain’s foot?”

    “Oh!” I exclaimed, “across the fields of woe
    I came this morn, and in the first life am,
    though by thus going, I’ll the other win.”

    When once my answer had been heard, Sordello
    and he drew back, like people suddenly
    perplexed. The first to Virgil turned, the other,
    to one who there was seated, crying out:
    “Get up, Corrado! Come and see what God
    hath as a favor willed.”

    Then, turned toward me:
    “By that rare gratitude thou owest Him,
    who hides His primal Why in such a way,
    that there ’s no fording it; when thou art past
    the wide waves, ask my Joan to pray for me
    where to the innocent replies are given.
    I think her mother loves me now no more,
    for those white wimples hath she laid aside,
    which she, poor soul, must needs want back again.

    Through her one understands with greatest ease
    how long the fire of love in woman lasts,
    unless rekindled oft by sight and touch.
    The Viper which conducts the Milanese
    afield, will never make as beautiful
    a tomb for her, as would Gallura’s Cock.”

    These were the words he used, his countenance
    marked with the impress of that righteous zeal,
    which burneth in the heart with temperate flame.
    My greedy eyes now sought the sky alone,
    and only there, where slowest are the stars,
    as, nearest to its axle, is a wheel.

    My Leader then: “What art thou looking at
    up there, my son?” And I: “At those three torches,
    wherewith the pole on this side wholly burns.”

    Then he: “The four bright stars which thou this morn
    didst see, are low down on the other side;
    and these have risen there, where those were then.”

    While he was speaking thus, Sordello drew him
    aside, and saying: “Yonder see our foe!”
    lifted his finger up, to have him look.

    On that side where the little hollowed vale
    hath no defense, a Snake there was like that,
    perhaps, which gave the bitter fruit to Eve.
    On through the grass and flowers the wicked reptile
    glided, and, turning back its head at times,
    was licking like a beast that smoothes itself.

    I did not see, and therefore cannot tell,
    how the celestial Falcons ’gan to move,
    but both I clearly saw, when once in motion.
    When cleft by their green wings it heard the air,
    the Serpent fled, and back the Angels turning,
    regained their posts above with equal flight.

    The shade who, when he called him, to the Judge
    had closely drawn, throughout the whole assault
    had not one moment loosed his gaze from me.

    “So may the lantern leading thee above,
    find in thy will the wax that is required
    for one to reach the enamelled green on high;”
    he thus began, “if thou of Valdimagra,
    or of its neighboring land, dost know true news,
    tell it to me, who once was mighty there.
    Corrado Malaspina I was called;
    I ’m not the elder, but from him descended;
    I bore my race the love which here is cleansed.”

    “Oh!” said I then to him, “I ’ve never been
    in your domains, but where throughout all Europe
    dwelleth a man who knows them not? The fame
    which honoreth your house, proclaims its lords,
    proclaims its district, so that even he
    knows of them, who hath never been there yet.
    I swear to you, so may I go on high,
    that of the glorious use of purse and sword
    your honored race doth not despoil itself.

    Nature and use so favor it, that, howe’er
    the guilty Head distort the world, alone
    it goeth straight, and scorns the evil path.”

    And he: “Now go, for lo, the sun shall not
    seven times on that bed rest him, which the Ram
    now covers, and with all four feet bestrides,
    ere this thy courteously expressed opinion
    shall in the middle of thy head be nailed
    with greater nails than words of other men,
    unless the course of doom decreed be stayed.”

PURGATORIO IX

Antepurgatory. The Vale of Flowers

Dante’s First Dream. The Gate of Purgatory

    Already was old Titan’s concubine
    whitening upon the Orient’s balcony,
    outside the arms of her sweet paramour;
    already was her forehead shining bright
    with gems, arranged according to the shape
    of that cold beast, which smites one with its tail;
    and Night had of the steps wherewith she climbs,
    already taken two where we were then,
    and now the third was lowering its wings;
    when I, who had somewhat of Adam in me,
    o’ercome with sleep, reclined upon the grass,
    on which all five of us were sitting then.

    Near morning, at the hour in which the swallow
    begins to sing her melancholy lays,
    perchance in memory of her earliest woes,
    and when, much more a pilgrim from the flesh,
    and less imprisoned by its thoughts, our mind
    well nigh prophetic in its vision is;
    an Eagle in a dream I seemed to see
    suspended in the sky, with plumes of gold
    and wings outspread, intent on swooping down;

    and it appeared to me that I was where
    his friends were left behind by Ganymede,
    when to the highest council he was raised.

    I thought within myself: “Perhaps this bird
    is wont to strike but here, and from elsewhere,
    perhaps, disdains to lift one with its claws.”
    Then, having wheeled a while, it seemed to me
    that terrible as lightning it came down,
    and bore me up as far as to the fire.
    There it and I both seemed to burn together;
    and so intense was that imagined burning,
    my sleep was broken of necessity.

    Achilles roused himself no differently —
    turning around him his awakened eyes,
    nor knowing in what region he might be,
    when, sleeping in her arms, his mother took him
    away from Chiron to the isle of Scyros,
    from which the Greeks removed him afterwards —
    than I aroused myself, when from my face
    sleep fled away; and death-like pale I turned,
    like one who freezes when o’ercome by fright.
    Only my Comforter was at my side,
    and now the sun was higher than two hours,
    and toward the open sea my face was turned.

    “Be not afraid!” my Lord then said to me.
    “Be reassured, for we are faring well;
    restrain not, but expand thine every power!

    At Purgatory art thou now arrived;
    behold the cliff there, which encloses it;
    behold the entrance where it broken seems.
    Just now, when, in the dawn preceding day,
    thy soul was sleeping in thee on the flowers,
    wherewith the place down yonder is adorned,
    a Lady came and said: ‘I am Lucìa;
    allow me to take up this sleeping man;
    I shall assist him thus upon his way.’
    Sordello and the other noble forms
    remained; she took thee, and when daylight dawned,
    hither came up, and in her foot-prints I.
    She laid thee here; and first her lovely eyes
    revealed to me that opened entrance; then
    both she and sleep together passed away.”

    Like one who, when in doubt, is reassured,
    and into comfort turns his fear, when once
    the truth has been disclosed to him, I changed;
    and when my Leader wholly freed from care
    beheld me, upward o’er the cliff he moved,
    and I behind him followed toward the height.

    Reader, thou surely see’st how I exalt
    my subject; therefore be thou not surprised
    if I support it now with greater art.

    Nearer we drew, and were in such a place,
    that where at first there seemed to be a break,
    just like a fissure that divides a wall,

    I saw a Gate, and under, to approach it,
    three steps of different color each, and then
    a Keeper, who as yet said not a word.
    And as I opened more and more mine eyes,
    I saw him sitting on the upper step,
    such in his face that I endured him not;
    and in his hand he had a naked sword,
    which so reflected upon us its rays,
    that toward him oft I turned my eyes in vain.

    “Say what it is you wish, from where you are,”
    he then began, “and where your escort is.
    Beware lest coming up should do you harm.”

    “A heavenly Lady, of these things aware,”
    my Teacher answered him, “said unto us
    just now: ‘Go thither, yonder is the Gate.’”

    “And unto good may she advance your steps!”
    the courteous Keeper of the Gate resumed,
    “Come forward, therefore, unto these our stairs.”

    Made of white marble was the first great step
    to which we came, so polished and so smooth,
    I mirrored me therein as I appear.
    The second step, darker than purple-black,
    was of a rough and calcined kind of stone,
    cracked lengthwise and across. The third, which rests
    in massive shape above it, seemed to me
    to be of porphyry as flaming red,
    as blood appears when spurting from a vein.

    Upon this last God’s Angel held both feet,
    sitting upon the threshold, which to me
    appeared to be a rock of adamant.

    Up over those three steps my Leader then
    drew me along with my good will, and said:
    “Humbly request him to undo the lock.”
    Devoutly at his holy feet I cast me;
    I begged that of his mercy he would open,
    but first I smote upon my breast three times.

    Then with his sword’s sharp point he traced seven P’s
    upon my brow, and told me: “See thou to it,
    that, when inside, thou wash away these wounds!”

    Ashes, or earth when excavated dry,
    would with his garment of one color be;
    and from beneath it he drew forth two Keys.
    One was of gold, the other silver was;
    first with the white, and after with the yellow,
    he so did to the Gate that I was pleased.

    “Whenever one of these Keys faileth so,
    that in the lock it doth not rightly turn,”
    said he to us, “this passage opens not.
    More precious is the first; and yet the other,
    ere it unlock, much skill and judgment needs,
    for it is that one which unties the knot.
    Peter, from whom I hold them, bade me err
    rather in opening, than in keeping closed,
    provided folk fell prostrate at my feet.”

    He pushed the holy Portal’s door thereat,
    and said to us: “Go in; but I inform you
    that he who looks behind returns outside.”
    And when that sacred Gateway’s folding doors,
    which were of strong resounding metal made,
    were on their iron hinges turned around,
    Tarpeia roared not so, nor proved so shrill,
    when good Metellus was removed from her,
    because of which she afterwards kept lean.

    I turned to heed its first resounding tones,
    and “Thee we praise, O Lord” I seemed to hear
    in voices mixed with those delightful sounds.
    What I was hearing made upon me then
    just the impression one is wont to get,
    when people with an organ sing; for now
    the words are heard, and now again are not.

PURGATORIO X

Purgatory. The First Ring. Pride

Instances of Humility. The Expiation of Pride

    When past the threshold of the Gate we were,
    whose use the evil love of souls impairs,
    because it makes the crooked path seem straight,
    ’t was by its sound I knew that it had closed;
    and, had I turned mine eyes in its direction,
    what would have fittingly excused my fault?

    We mounted through a fissure in the rock,
    which moved about to this side and to that,
    as moves a wave that flees and draweth near.
    “A little skill must here be used by us,”
    my Leader then began, “in keeping close,
    now here, now there, to the receding side.”

    This caused our steps to be so slow and short,
    that to her bed the waning moon had gone
    to rest herself again, ere we had issued
    forth from that needle’s eye; but when set free
    we were, and in the open up above,
    where back the Mountain’s side recedes, I, weary,
    and both of us uncertain of our way,
    stopped short upon a level place up there,
    more lonely than are roads through desert lands.

    From where its margin borders on the void,
    up to the foot of that high rising bank,
    would measure thrice a human body’s length;
    and far as e’er mine eye could wing its flight,
    now on the right, and now upon the left,
    such did this girding ledge appear to me.

    Our feet had not been moving on it yet,
    when I perceived the bank surrounding it —
    which, being perpendicular, could not
    be climbed — white marble was, and so adorned
    with carvings, that not only Polyclètus,
    but Nature, too, would there be put to shame.

    The Angel who to earth came with the word
    of peace, which, wept-for during many years,
    had after its long closure opened Heaven,
    appeared before us there in gentle mien,
    sculptured so truthfully, it did not seem
    that he could be an image that is dumb.
    One would have sworn that he was saying: “Hail!”
    for She was there portrayed in effigy,
    who turned the key that opened Love on high;
    and in her mien and acts she had the words
    “Behold the handmaid of the Lord” impressed
    as clearly as a figure stamped in wax.

    “Keep not thy mind on one place only fixed!”
    my gentle Teacher said, who had me there
    on that side of him, where one has his heart;

    I therefore moved my eyes, and further on
    than Mary, on the side where him I had,
    who urged me to go on, I then beheld
    another story graven in the rock;
    passing by Virgil, therefore, I drew near
    so that it might be set before mine eyes.

    Cut in the marble there the cart and oxen
    were drawing up the holy Ark, which made
    men dread a charge not given them in trust.
    People in front appeared; and all of them,
    forming seven choirs, made one of my two senses
    say “No,” and the other one say “Yes, they sing.”
    So, too, by reason of the incense-smoke,
    which there was pictured forth, my eyes and nose
    became discordant as to Yes and No.
    The humble Psalmist there, with loins girt up,
    came dancing on, before the blessèd Vessel,
    and, doing so, was more and less than king.
    And Michal, opposite to this portrayed,
    was from a palace window looking down,
    as would an angry woman filled with scorn.

    From where I was, I onward moved my feet,
    that I might closely note another tale,
    which after Michal gleamed upon me white.
    The glorious action of that Roman prince
    was storied here, whose worth moved Gregory
    to win his mighty triumph; I refer

    to Emperor Trajan; at his bridle stood
    a widow who, in tears, showed signs of grief.
    The space around him there seemed trampled down
    and thronged with horsemen, while above his head
    eagles, it seemed, upon a field of gold
    were fluttering in the wind. Among all these
    the sorrowing woman seemed to say: “My lord,
    avenge me for the slaying of my son,
    which breaks my heart.” And he to answer her:
    “Wait now till I return.” And she, like one
    whom sorrow makes impatient, said: “But what,
    my lord, if thou shouldst not return?” And he:
    “That one will do it, who shall hold my place.”
    “How shall another’s goodness help thy case,”
    she answered him, “if thou forget thine own?”
    Then he: “Now be thou comforted; for needs
    must I perform my duty ere I leave;
    justice so wills, and pity keeps me here.”

    He to whose vision naught was ever new,
    created this seen language, new to us,
    since not found here on earth. While with delight
    I looked upon the pictures of such great
    humilities, which for their Maker’s sake
    are also dear to see, “On this side, lo,
    much people come, but slow the steps they take;”
    the Poet murmured, “toward the grades above
    these souls will send us forward on our way.”

    Mine eyes, intent on gazing, to behold
    new things, for which with eagerness they long,
    in turning toward him were not slow to move.
    Yet I ’d not have thee, Reader, shrink dismayed
    from thy good purposes, through hearing how
    God wills that what is due be paid. Heed not
    the nature of the torment! Think of what
    comes after! Think that, at the very worst,
    beyond the Judgment-day it cannot go.

    Then I began: “That, Teacher, which toward us
    I see advancing does not look like people,
    nor know I what, my sight is so deceived.”

    And he to me: “Their torment’s heavy nature
    so bows them toward the ground, that my eyes, too,
    struggled therewith at first. But steadily
    gaze there, and disentangle with thine eyes
    what underneath those stones is coming on;
    thou now canst see how each one smites himself.”

    O ye proud Christians, sad and weary creatures,
    who, sick in mental vision, put your trust
    in backward moving steps; perceive ye not
    that worms we are, created but to form
    the angelic butterfly, which flies unscreened
    to judgment? Why, then, is it that your mind
    soars up in pride, since ye are, as it were,
    defective insects, even as is a worm,
    in which formation is not yet complete?

    As, to hold up a ceiling or a roof,
    in lieu of corbel, one perceives at times
    a human figure joining knees to breast,
    which out of unreality gives birth
    to real distress in him who sees it; such
    seemed these to me, when I had given good heed.

    They were, in truth, both more and less bowed down,
    as each had more or less upon his back;
    but he that in his acts most patient was,
    seemed to say, weeping: “I can bear no more!”

PURGATORIO XI

Purgatory. The First Ring. Pride

The Lord’s Prayer. The Proud

    “Our Father, Thou that in the Heavens dost dwell,
    not circumscribed, but for the greater love
    Thou hast for what Thou madest first on high;
    let both Thy Name and Worth be given praise
    by every creature, ev’n as it is meet
    that to Thy loving Spirit thanks be given!
    And may Thy Kingdom’s Peace come down to us,
    since we can not attain it of ourselves,
    for all our striving, save it also come!
    As gladly of their wills Thine Angels make
    a sacrifice to Thee, singing ‘All Hail!’,
    so likewise gladly may men do with theirs!
    Give us this day our daily spirit-food,
    without which, through this bitter wilderness,
    he backward goes, who onward toileth most!
    And as we pardon every one the wrong
    we ’ve suffered, of Thy Mercy do Thou us
    forgive, regarding not what we deserve!
    Our virtue which is easily o’ercome,
    test Thou not through our ancient Enemy,
    but set us free from him, who tempts it so!

    This last request, dear Lord, is not, indeed,
    made for ourselves, who need not make it here,
    but is for their sake who behind us stayed.”

    Thus praying good speed for themselves and us,
    those shades beneath a burden went their way,
    not unlike that whereof one dreams at times,
    unequally tormented, all of them,
    and weary, o’er the first ring, round and round,
    purging away the world’s defiling mists.

    If good things there be always said for us,
    what can be said and done on their behalf
    down here, by those whose will is rooted well?
    Surely one ought to help them wash away
    the stains they brought with them, that they may issue,
    cleansed and unburdened, to the starry spheres.

    “Pray, so may pity and Justice speedily
    unburden you, that ye may move your wings,
    and raise yourselves according to your wish,
    show us on which hand lies the shortest way
    to reach the stairs; and, be there more than one,
    teach us the pass that hath the gentlest slope;
    for, owing to the load of Adam’s flesh,
    which clothes his spirit, he who with me comes
    is slow in climbing, though against his will.”

    As to the words, which in reply they said
    to those which he, whom I was following, spoke,
    it was not evident from whom they came;

    but this was said: “Come with us on the right
    along the bank, and ye shall find the pass,
    which may be climbed by one that’s still alive.
    And were I not prevented by the stone,
    which tames my haughty neck, and forces me
    to keep my face bowed down, at this man here,
    who liveth still and telleth not his name,
    I ’d look, to see if he is one I know,
    and stir his pity for this heavy load.
    Latin I was, and born to a great Tuscan;
    Guglielmo Aldobrandesco was my father;
    I know not if you ever knew his name.
    My forebears’ ancient blood and noble deeds
    caused me to be so arrogant, that I,
    unmindful of our common mother, earth,
    held every man in scorn to such extent,
    I died for it, as well knows Siena’s folk,
    and every child in Campagnàtico.
    I am Omberto; nor to me alone
    doth this work ill, for pride hath with itself
    drawn all my kin into calamity.
    And here, for this, must I needs bear this load
    among the dead, till God be satisfied,
    since I among the living bore it not.”

    Listening, I bowed my face; and one of them,
    not he who had been speaking, writhed around
    under the burden which was hampering him;

    and, having seen and recognized me, called,
    and kept his eyes with effort fixed on me,
    who, as I went along with them, was stooping.

    Then “Oh!” said I, “Art thou not Oderisi,
    the glory of Agobbio and the art,
    which is in Paris called ‘illuminating’?”

    “Brother,” said he, “more smiling are the parchments
    which Franco Bolognese paints; the glory
    is now all his and only partly mine.
    Because of that great longing to excel,
    whereon my heart was set, I certainly
    would not have been so courteous while I lived.
    Here is the forfeit paid for pride like this;
    nor should I be here yet, had it not been
    that, while I still could sin, I turned to God.
    O empty glory of our human powers,
    how short a time green lasts upon its top,
    unless uncultured ages overtake it!
    Once Cimabùe thought that he would hold
    the field in painting, yet the cry is all
    for Giotto now, hence that one’s fame is dark.
    Thus hath one Guido taken from the other
    the glory of our tongue; and he is born,
    perhaps, who from the nest will banish both.
    Worldly repute is but a breath of wind,
    which cometh now from here, and now from there,
    and shifts its name, because its quarter shifts.

    What greater fame shalt thou have — if when old
    thou quit thy flesh, than hadst thou died ere ‘pap’
    and ‘chink’ were dropped, — a thousand years from now?
    For that, if to eternity compared,
    is shorter than the twinkling of an eye
    is to the sky’s most slowly moving sphere.
    All Tuscany proclaimed the fame of him,
    who walks so slowly on the road before me;
    yet hardly is a whisper of him left
    in Siena now, whose governor he was,
    what time the rage of Florence was destroyed,
    which then as haughty was, as abject now.
    Your worldly fame is like the hue of grass,
    which comes and goes, and he discolors it,
    through whom it springs up tender from the ground.”

    And I: “Thy true speech heart’ning me with good
    humility, thou prickst my swollen pride;
    but who is he of whom thou spok’st just now?

    “That” he replied, “is Provenzàn Salvani;
    and here he is, because presumptuously
    he brought all Siena under his control.
    Thus hath he gone, and without rest he goes,
    e’er since he died; who yonder dares too much,
    in satisfaction pays such coin as this.”

    And I then: “If the spirit who delays,
    before repenting, till the verge of life,
    abides below, and cometh not up here,

    unless good prayers assist him, till as long
    a time be passed as he had been alive,
    wherefore hath this man’s coming been vouchsafed?”

    “When in his greatest glory,” he replied,
    “all shame removed, he freely took his stand
    in Siena’s Campo;
    and there, to free a friend
    suffering in Charles’ prison, he brought himself
    to quake in every vein. I ’ll say no more,
    and know that what I say is darkly spoken;
    but so, ere long, will thine own neighbors act,
    that thou ’lt be able to interpret it.
    This deed of his relieved him from those bounds.”

PURGATORIO XII

Purgatory. The First Ring. Pride

Instances of Punished Pride. The Angel of Humility

    With equal steps, like oxen going yoked,
    I went along beside that burdened soul,
    as long as my dear Pedagogue allowed;
    but when he said: “Leave him, and go thou on;
    for here ’t is well that each should urge his bark
    with sail and oars, as much as e’er he can,”
    I straightened me
    as much as walking called for,
    although my thoughts kept humble and depressed.

    On had I moved, and in my Teacher’s steps
    was following willingly, and both of us
    were showing now how light of step we were,
    when “Downward turn thine eyes!” he said to me,
    “Well will it be, to calm thee on thy way,
    that thou shouldst see the bed thy soles are treading.”

    As over those that ’neath them buried lie
    — that they may be recalled to people’s minds —
    tombs level with the ground the record bear
    of what they were before; whence there they oft
    are wept for, through the prick of memory,
    which spurs to grief the pitiful alone;

    ev’n so I saw engraved in sculpture here,
    though finer in respect to workmanship,
    as much as from the Mount juts out as path.

    I saw, on one side, Him who once was made
    nobler by far than any other creature,
    fall like a flash of lightning down from Heaven.

    I saw Briareus, on the other side,
    pierced by an arrow from the sky, lie prone,
    and heavy on the ground with mortal cold.

    I saw Apollo, Mars I saw and Pallas,
    as, still in armor, round their Sire they stood,
    gazing upon the Giants’ scattered limbs.

    I saw great Nimrod ’neath his mighty work
    dumb with confusion, as he watched the folk,
    who once were proud with him on Shinar’s plain.

    O Niobe, with what sad eyes I thee
    saw pictured forth in stone, between thy children,
    the seven and seven thy dead, upon the road!

    O Saul, how plainly there on thine own sword
    didst thou seem dead upon Gilbòa’s mount,
    which felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!

    O mad Arachne, thee I saw, as when,
    already half a spider, thou wast sad
    amid the tatters of thy fatal work.

    O Rehoboam, not a threat seems now
    thy face, but terror-stricken, as away
    a chariot bears thee, lest thou be pursued.

    It showed, moreover, that hard pavement did,
    how costly once Alcmaeon caused his mother’s
    unlucky ornament to seem to her.

    It showed how, in the temple’s walls, his sons
    cast themselves on Sennacherib, and how,
    when he was dead, they there abandoned him.

    It showed the slaughter and the cruel woe
    wrought by Tomyris, when she said to Cyrus:
    “With blood I fill thee, that didst thirst for blood!”

    It showed, too, how the Assyrians took to flight,
    routed, when Holophernes had been killed,
    and also what was of that slaughter left.

    I saw proud Troy in ashes and in caves.
    O Ilion, how degraded and how vile
    it showed thou wast, the image there perceived!

    What master, or of brush or graving-tool,
    could reproduce the shadows and the features,
    which there would cause all cultured minds to wonder?
    The dead seemed dead, the living seemed alive;
    whoever saw the real, no better saw
    than I then did what I was treading on,
    as long as bowed I walked. Be ye, then, proud,
    and go with haughty looks, ye sons of Eve,
    nor bow your heads, to see your evil path!

    More of the Mountain had we circled now,
    and of the sun’s course far more had we spent,
    than my not disengaged mind had supposed;

    when he who always walked attentively
    ahead of me, began: “Lift up thy head!
    The time for going thus absorbed is passed.
    See there an Angel who is making ready
    to come toward us; see how the sixth handmaiden
    returns now from the service of the day.
    With reverence adorn thine acts and face,
    that he may now be pleased to send us up;
    think that this day will never dawn again!”

    So well accustomed was I to his warning,
    that I should never let my time be lost,
    that on this theme he could not darkly speak.

    Toward us the lovely Creature was advancing,
    arrayed in white, and in his countenance,
    such as, when trembling, seems the morning star.
    His arms he opened, then he oped his wings,
    and said to us: “Come; near by are the steps,
    and going up is easy after this.”

    Only a few to this announcement come.
    O human race, why, born for upward flight,
    fallest thou so before a little wind?

    He led us on to where the rock was cut;
    and there my forehead with his wings he stroked,
    and promised that my passage would be safe.

    As, on the right hand, to ascend the mount,
    where seated is the church, which dominates
    the well ruled town o’er Rubaconte’s bridge,

    the slope’s bold flight is broken by the stairs
    constructed in an age, when quire and stave
    were safe;
    so, likewise, doth the bank relax,
    which from the next ledge here quite steeply falls;
    but closely on each side the high rock rubs.

    While, turning thither, we were on our way,
    “Blest are the poor in spirit!” voices sang
    in such a way as words could not describe.

    Alas! how different are the passes here
    from those in Hell! For one up here goes in
    with songs, but there below with frightful wails!

    We now were climbing up the holy stairs,
    and lighter far I felt than formerly
    I seemed to be, when on the level ground;
    I hence said: “Teacher, say, what heavy thing
    has been removed from me, that, as I walk,
    I almost feel no weariness at all?”

    He answered: “When the P’s, which still remain
    almost extinct upon thy brow, are quite
    erased, as one is now, thy feet will so
    be conquered by good will, that they will feel
    not only no fatigue, but it will be
    a pleasure to them to be upward urged.”

    I then did as do those, who go about
    with something on their head they know not of,
    till others’ gestures cause them to suspect;

    whereat their hand assists in ascertaining,
    searches, and finds, and so performs the work,
    which cannot be accomplished by their sight;
    and with my right hand’s fingers spread I found
    that only six the letters were, which he
    who held the Keys, had o’er my temples cut;
    on seeing which my Leader smiled with joy.

PURGATORIO XIII

Purgatory. The Second Ring. Envy

Instances of Generosity. The Envious

    We now were at the summit of the stairs,
    where for the second time is cut away
    the Mount, ascent of which frees one from sin;
    and there a cornice, like the first one, girds
    the hillside round about, save that its arc
    more quickly curves. There is no shaded carving
    apparent here, nor is there any mark;
    the bank seems bare, as also seems the path,
    with but the livid color of the rock.

    “If we await folk here, of whom to ask
    our way,” the Poet argued, “I ’m afraid
    our choice will be, perhaps, delayed too long.”

    Then on the sun he fixed his steadfast eyes,
    made of his right the center for his motion,
    and turned the left side of himself around.

    “O thou sweet light, with confidence in whom
    I enter this new path, conduct us thou,”
    he said, “as one should be conducted here.
    Thou warm’st the world, and on it thou dost shine;
    if aught else urge not to the contrary,
    thy rays at all times ought to be our guides.”

    Already had we gone as far up there,
    as here on earth is reckoned for a mile,
    in little time, because of ready will;
    when, flying toward us, there were spirits heard,
    who, though unseen, were to the board of love
    uttering their courteous calls.

    The voice which first
    passed flying, said aloud: “They have no wine!”
    and then behind us kept repeating it;
    and ere, because of having moved away,
    it could be heard no more, another, passing,
    cried: “I ’m Orestes!” nor did that one linger.

    “What are these voices, Father?” said I then;
    and ev’n while I was asking, lo, a third,
    which said: “Love those, from whom ye’ve ill received!”

    The kindly Teacher then: “This circle whips
    the fault of envy, hence the scourge’s cords
    are drawn from love. The curb will probably
    give forth a sound the contrary of this;
    in my opinion, I believe thou ’lt hear it,
    before the pass of pardon thou attain.
    But keenly through the air address thy gaze,
    and thou ’lt see people on ahead of us,
    who seated are, and each against the cliff.”

    Then wider than before I oped mine eyes;
    I looked ahead, and shades I saw with cloaks
    not differing from the color of the stone.

    And when a little further on we were,
    I heard one crying: “Mary, pray for us!”
    and cries to Michael, Peter, and all the Saints.
    Nor do I think there walks on earth to-day
    a man so hard, that he would not be pierced
    by sympathy for what I then perceived;
    for, after I had drawn so near to them,
    that what they did with clearness came to me,
    tears from my eyes were drawn by bitter grief.
    Covered they seemed to me with coarse hair-cloth,
    and one sustained the other with his shoulder,
    while all of them were by the bank sustained.

    Ev’n thus the blind, in want of livelihood,
    at Pardons stand to beg for what they need,
    and one upon the other bows his head,
    that pity may be speedily aroused,
    not merely by the sound of what they say,
    but by their aspect, which no less implores.

    And as the sun availeth not the blind,
    so to the shades, whereof I spoke just now,
    the sky’s light willeth not to grant itself;
    because an iron band runs through, and sews
    the eyelids of them all, as with wild hawks
    one does, since otherwise they ’d not keep still.

    To me it seemed an outrage that, unseen,
    I should see others, as I walked along;
    I therefore turned to my wise Counselor.

    He well knew what the dumb man wished to say;
    and therefore waited not for me to ask,
    but “Speak,” he said, “be brief and to the point.”

    Virgil on that side of the cornice-ledge
    was coming on with me, whence one can fall,
    because it wreathes itself with no bank there.
    On the other side I had those zealous shades,
    who through the horrid seams were pressing so
    their tears, that they were bathing both their cheeks.

    Turning to them, I thus began: “O people,
    who certain are of seeing that High Light,
    which your desire hath for its only object;
    so melt Grace soon the scum upon your conscience,
    that memory’s stream may through it clearly flow,
    tell me, for grateful will it be to me
    and pleasing, if there is among you here
    a soul that Latin is; it will be well
    for him, perhaps, if I should come to know it.”

    “O brother mine, we both are citizens
    of one true City; but thou meanest one,
    who, while a pilgrim, lived in Italy.”

    It seemed to me that this I heard for answer
    a little further on than where I was;
    I therefore let myself be heard much further.
    Among the rest I saw a shade which seemed
    expectant in its looks; and, if one ask
    “How so?” held up its chin as do the blind.

    “Spirit,” said I, “that dost subdue thyself,
    that thou mayst climb, if she that didst reply,
    make thyself known to me by place or name.”

    “Sienese I was;” she answered, “and with these
    cleanse here my guilty life, and pray to Him
    with tears, that He may lend Himself to us.
    Though called Sapìa, sapient was I not,
    for I was far more glad of others’ harm,
    than I of my good fortune ever was.
    And, that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,
    ev’n as I tell thee, hear how mad I was,
    once my years’ arch was on its downward course.
    When with their foes my fellow citizens
    were joined in battle near the town of Colle,
    I prayed to God for that which He had willed.
    When, routed there, they took the bitter path
    of flight, I felt, on seeing them pursued,
    a joy unequalled by all other joys;
    I therefore upward turned my daring face,
    and cried to God: ‘I fear Thee now no more!’
    as doth the blackbird at the least fair weather.
    When I was at the end of life, I longed
    for peace with God; but not yet would my debt
    have been diminished by repentance here,
    had it not been that Pietro Pettinagno,
    who of his charity was grieved for me,
    was mindful of me in his holy prayers.

    But who art thou, that askest of our state
    while going on, and hast thine eyes unclosed,
    as I believe, and dost, while breathing, talk?”

    “Mine eyes will yet be taken from me here,
    but not for long;” said I, “for they have not
    offended much by being turned by envy.
    Far greater is the fear, wherewith my soul
    is filled, of that tormenting pain below,
    for even now the load there weighs upon me.”

    And she: “Who, then, led thee to us up here,
    if to return below thou think?” And I:
    “He that is with me here, and speaketh not.
    But I am living, therefore ask of me,
    elected spirit, if thou’dst have me move
    my mortal feet in thy behalf on earth.”

    “Oh, this” she answered, “is so strange to hear,
    that certainly it proves God’s love for thee;
    therefore assist me with thy prayers at times!
    I beg thee by what most thou longest for,
    if e’er thou tread the soil of Tuscany,
    that thou among my kin restore my fame.
    Among that vain folk wilt thou see them there,
    which hopes in Talamone, and will waste
    more hope on it than on the Diàna quest;
    but still more will the admirals invest.”

PURGATORIO XIV

Romagna in 1300. Instances of punished Envy

    “Who is this spirit, who around our Mount
    is circling thus, ere death have giv’n him flight,
    and at his will opens and veils his eyes?”

    “I know not who he is, but know he ’s not
    alone; ask thou, that nearer art to him,
    and greet him fairly, so that he may speak.”

    Two spirits, who were leaning on each other,
    thus talked of me upon the right hand there;
    then turned their faces up, to speak to me;
    and one said: “Soul, that, still held in thy body,
    toward Heaven art going, of thy charity
    console us now, and tell us whence thou com’st,
    and who thou art; for thou dost cause in us
    such wonder at the grace accorded thee,
    as that demands which never was before.”

    And I: “A small stream winds through Tuscany,
    which up in Falterona hath its rise,
    and is not sated by a hundred miles.
    From somewhere on its banks I bring this body;
    vain would it be to tell you who I am,
    because my name makes no great sound as yet.”

    “If with my mind I rightly penetrate
    thy meaning,” that one then replied to me;
    who spoke before, “thou talkest of the Arno.”

    Thereat the other spirit said to him:
    “Why did this man conceal that river’s name,
    as people hide the name of dreadful things?”

    The shade who had been questioned as to this,
    discharged its duty thus: “I do not know;
    but meet it is that this vale’s name should die!
    For from its source — where that wild mountain-chain,
    whence severed is Pelorus, swells so greatly,
    that in few places doth it pass that mark —
    to there where it betakes it to restore
    whatever from the sea the sky sucks up,
    whence rivers get what goes along with them,
    virtue is, snake-like, as a foe pursued
    by all, or through the region’s evil luck,
    or through bad customs which incite men there;
    hence those that in this wretched valley dwell,
    have changed their nature so, that it would seem
    that Circe had them in her pasturage.

    Among foul hogs, of acorns worthier far
    than of all other food that’s fit for man
    to use, it first directs its sorry path.
    As down it comes, it afterward finds curs,
    that snarl more fiercely than their strength comports,
    and turns from these its snout aside in scorn.

    It keeps on falling; and the more it swells,
    the more that cursèd and unlucky ditch
    finds that the dogs are turning into wolves.
    Descending then through many a gloomy gorge,
    foxes it finds, so full of fraud, that naught
    have they to fear, lest cunning master them.
    Nor shall I cease to speak, though overheard;
    and for this man ’t were well, if he recall
    hereafter what a truthful spirit shows me.

    Thy grandson I behold, who first becomes
    a hunter of those wolves upon the banks
    of that fierce stream, and terrifies them all.
    He sells their flesh, while still alive; then kills them,
    as an old beast he would; of life depriving
    many, himself of honor he deprives.
    He issues bloody from the dismal wood,
    and leaves it such, that in a thousand years
    ’t will not rewood itself as once it was.”

    As at the announcement of some painful loss,
    the face of him who listens is disturbed,
    from wheresoe’er the danger may assail him;
    ev’n thus did I behold that other soul,
    who turned to listen, grow distressed and sad,
    as soon as he had gathered in that speech.

    The words of one soul and the other’s face
    had caused me to desire to know their names;
    therefore with prayers I mingled this request.

    That spirit, therefore, who addressed me first,
    began again: “Thou’dst have me condescend
    to do for thee what thou for me wilt not.
    But since God wills that so much of His Grace
    should shine in thee, I ’ll not be niggardly;
    Guido del Duca know, then, that I am.
    And so consumed by envy was my blood,
    that, had I seen a man becoming happy,
    livid with envy thou hadst seen me turn.
    Of what I sowed I ’m reaping now the straw.

    O human race, why set your heart on things,
    wherein companionship must be forbidden?

    This is Rinieri; this the honor is,
    and glory of the house of Calboli,
    whose worth, since him, none hath inherited.
    Nor hath his blood alone despoiled itself,
    ’tween Po and mountains, Reno and the sea,
    of those good things which truth and joy require;
    for in those bounds the country is so full
    of poisoned stocks, that only slowly now
    would they be lessened, ev’n if it were tilled.
    Where are good Lìzio, Arrigo Mainàrdi,
    Pier Traversaro and Guido di Carpigna?
    O Romagnoles, turned into bastards now!
    When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?
    When, in Faenza, a Bernardin di Fosco,
    the noble scion of a little plant?

    Wonder not, Tuscan, if I weep now, when,
    with Guido da Prata, I recall to mind
    Ugolin d’Azzo, who among us dwelt,
    Frederick Tignoso and his company,
    the Traversara house, the Anastagi,
    (and both these families are void of heirs),
    the ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,
    which love and courtesy once made us crave,
    where hearts have grown so bad! O Brettinoro,
    wherefore not vanish, since thy family,
    and many people with them, have departed,
    that guiltless they might be? Bàgnacavàl,
    begetting sons no longer, doeth well;
    but Castrocaro ill, and Conio worse,
    which still takes trouble to beget such counts.
    Well the Pagani, too, will fare, when once
    their demon shall have gone, but not so well,
    that an unspotted fame will e’er remain
    to them. O Ugolin de’ Fàntoli,
    thy name is safe, since one can now no more
    be looked for, who, as a degenerate,
    can darken it! But go thy way now, Tuscan;
    for weeping now affords me far more zest
    than speech, our talk hath so distressed my mind!”

    We knew that those dear spirits heard us leaving;
    and therefore merely by their keeping still,
    they made us trust the path which we were taking.

    When we, advancing, found ourselves alone,
    a voice, which seemed like lightning when it cleaves
    the air, was heard, and, as it reached us there,
    said: “Whosoever findeth me shall slay me!”
    then vanished, as when thunder rolls away,
    if suddenly a cloud be rent apart.

    Soon as our hearing had a truce from this,
    behold another with so great a crash,
    it seemed to be its following thunder-clap:
    “I am Aglauros, who was turned to stone!”
    Then, to draw closer to the Poet’s side,
    I took a backward, not a forward, step.

    The air was calm on all sides now, when he:
    “That was the painful bit, which in his bounds
    should hold a man. But ye take in the bait,
    and so the ancient Adversary’s hook
    draweth you to him; hence of small avail
    is either curb or lure.
    Heaven calleth you,
    and, showing to you its eternal beauties,
    around you moves, and yet your eyes look down;
    hence He, who seeth all things, scourges you.”

PURGATORIO XV

Purgatory. The Second Ring. Envy. The Angel of

Generosity. The Third Ring. Anger. Instances of Gentleness

    Between the third hour’s close and day’s beginning
    as much as is apparent of the sphere,
    which like a child is ever given to play,
    so much now of its course toward evening seemed
    remaining to the sun; ’t was vespers there,
    and midnight here; and fully on the face
    its rays were striking us, because the Mount
    had so been circled by us, that we now
    were going on directly toward the West;
    when, far more blindingly than e’er before,
    I felt my forehead overcome by splendor,
    and was bewildered by these unknown things;
    over my eyebrows, hence, I raised my hands,
    and made myself the screen which, filing off,
    tempers excessive light in what is seen.

    As when from water, or a looking-glass,
    a ray leaps up in the opposite direction,
    and in the same way mounts that down it came,
    and from the falling of a stone departs
    at equal distance to the same extent,
    as both experiment and art reveal;

    even so it seemed to me that I was smitten
    as by a light, reflected there before me;
    because of which my sight was swift to flee.

    “Dear Father, what is that,” said I, “from which
    I cannot screen my face sufficiently
    to help me, and which toward us seems to come?”

    “Wonder thou not” he answered me, “if still
    Heaven’s family affect thy sight; an Angel
    is this, who comes to ask us to ascend.
    It soon will happen that to see such things
    will be no burden, but as great a joy,
    as Nature hath enabled thee to feel.”

    As soon as we had reached the blessèd Angel,
    with joyful voice he said: “Enter from hence
    a stairway far less steep than were the rest!”

    We were ascending, having thence departed,
    when “Blessèd are the Merciful!” was sung
    behind us, and “Rejoice, O thou that winnest!”

    My Teacher then, and I, we two alone,
    were going up; and, as we went, I thought
    of how I might get profit from his words;
    whereat I turned toward him, and asked: “What meant
    that spirit from Romagna, when he mentioned
    ‘forbidden,’ and ‘companionship’ in things?”

    Hence he: “Of his worst fault he knows the harm;
    hence let it not surprise, if he therefor
    rebuke men, that it be lamented less.

    Because your wishes aim at that, wherein
    each share is lessened through companionship,
    envy fain moves the bellows for your sighs.
    If love, though, for the highest sphere of all
    were upward turning your desires, that fear
    would not be in your breast; because the more
    there are up yonder by whom ‘Ours’ is said,
    so much more good doth each of them possess,
    and so much more love in that cloister burns.”

    “I fast much more from being satisfied,”
    said I, “than had I silent been at first;
    and more of doubt I gather in my mind.
    How can it be, then, that a good that’s shared
    should make more owners richer with itself,
    than if by but a few it be possessed?”

    And he to me: “Because thou fastenest
    thy mind exclusively on earthly things,
    thou drawest darkness out of very light.
    That Good, Ineffable and Infinite,
    which dwells up yonder, runs as fast to love,
    as to bright bodies comes a ray of light.
    So much It gives Itself, as is the warmth
    It findeth; hence, as is the extent of love,
    so much the Eternal Worth spreads over it.
    The more there are up there that love each other,
    the more there are to love, and more the love,
    and, mirror-like, the more of love each sheds

    on each. And if my talk sate not thy hunger,
    thou shalt see Beatrice, and she will fully
    free thee from this and every other want.
    Do thou, then, see to it that speedily
    thou have removed, as two already are,
    the five wounds which are closed by causing pain.”

    Wishing to say: “Thou satisfiest me,”
    I saw that I had reached the following ring;
    my fond eyes, therefore, caused me to keep still.

    There it appeared to me that I was wrapt
    in an ecstatic vision all at once,
    and that within a temple I perceived
    much people; and a Lady at the door,
    who with the sweet mien of a mother said:
    “Wherefore, my Son, hast thou thus dealt with us?
    Behold, thy father and I have sought for thee
    in sorrow!” Here, when she had ceased to speak,
    that disappeared which had before appeared.

    Then there appeared another, o’er whose cheeks
    those tears were streaming down, which grief distills,
    when born of great resentment toward another,
    saying: “If thou art master of the city,
    about whose name there was among the gods
    such strife, and whence all knowledge sparkles forth,
    avenge thyself on those audacious arms,
    Pisìstratus, which dared embrace our daughter!”
    Kindly and gently then that lord appeared

    to answer her with looks of self-control:
    “What shall we do to him who hateth us,
    if he who loves us is by us condemned?”

    Then folk I saw inflamed by anger’s fire
    who, bent on killing a young man with stones,
    cried to each other naught but: “Kill him, kill!”
    And him I saw, bowed to the ground in death
    which now oppressed him; of his eyes he e’er
    made gates of Heaven, and in that anguish prayed
    the Lord on high with looks which unlock pity,
    that He his persecutors would forgive.

    When once my mind returned outside again
    to those things which outside of it are true,
    I recognized my not untruthful errors.

    My Leader, who could see that I was acting
    like one who frees himself from slumber, said:
    “What aileth thee, that thou canst not stand up,
    but hast been coming more than half a league,
    veiling thine eyes, and reeling with thy legs,
    like one o’ercome by either wine or sleep?”

    “O my dear Father, if thou listen to me,
    I ’ll tell thee what it was appeared to me,”
    said I, “when I was thus deprived of legs.”

    And he: “If on thy face a hundred masks
    thou hadst, thy thoughts would not be hid from me,
    however small they were. What thou hast seen

    was lest thou free thyself from opening up
    thy heart unto those waters of thy peace,
    which from the Eternal Fountain are diffused.
    I did not ask ‘What ails thee?’ as would one,
    who looks but with the eye which seeth not,
    when once the body lies inanimate;
    but asked it to endow thy feet with strength;
    so must the indolent be spurred, when slow
    to use their waking time, when it returns.”

    On through the vesper hours we went along,
    forward intent, as far as e’er our eyes
    could reach, against the late and shining rays;
    when lo, a smoke in our direction came
    little by little, and as dark as night;
    nor was there any place of shelter from it;
    this of pure air deprived us and of eyes.

PURGATORIO XVI

Purgatory. The Third Ring. Anger

Free Will and the Corruption of the World

    The gloom of Hell and of a night deprived
    of every planet, ’neath a narrow sky,
    darkened as much as possible by clouds,
    ne’er made so thick a veil before my face,
    nor to my feeling was so rough in tissue,
    as was the smoke which covered us up there;
    for that permitted not of opened eyes;
    because of which my wise and trusty Escort
    drew near to me, and offered me his shoulder.

    Even as a blind man walks behind his guide,
    in order not to go astray, and strike
    aught that might hurt him, or might even kill;
    so, going through that foul and bitter air,
    I listened to my Leader, who said only:
    “Take care that thou be not cut off from me!”

    Voices I heard, and each appeared to pray
    for peace and mercy to the Lamb of God,
    who taketh sins away. Their only prelude
    was “Lamb of God”; and all had but one word
    and intonation, hence among them all
    there seemed to be the fullest harmony.

    “Are those, then, spirits, Teacher, whom I hear?”
    said I; and he to me: “Thou judgest rightly;
    as on they go, they loosen anger’s knot.”

    “Now who art thou, that cleavest thus our smoke,
    and yet dost speak of us, as if thou still
    by monthly calends wert dividing time?”

    These words were uttered by a single voice;
    my Teacher therefore said to me: “Reply,
    and ask him if on this side one goes up.”

    And I: “O creature, that dost cleanse thyself,
    that beautiful thou mayst return to Him
    who made thee, thou’lt hear marvels, following me.”

    “I ’ll follow thee as far as I ’m allowed,”
    he answered, “and, if smoke permit not sight,
    hearing, instead, will keep us linked together.”

    I thereupon began: “I go on high
    while in that swathing-band which death dissolves;
    and through the infernal anguish came I here;
    and whereas God hath wrapt me in His Grace
    so much, that He would have me see His court
    by means entirely out of modern use,
    conceal not who thou wast before thy death,
    but tell it me, and whether toward the pass
    I rightly go; and be thy words our guides.”

    “Lombard I was, and Marco was I called;
    familiar with the world, I loved the worth,
    toward which all men have now unbent their bows.

    For mounting upward thou art going rightly.”
    He thus replied, and added: “I beseech thee,
    pray for me there, when thou shalt be above.”

    And I to him: “I pledge my faith to thee
    that what thou askest of me I will do;
    but with a doubt I ’ll burst, unless therefrom
    I free myself. Simple at first, it now
    is doubled by thy speech, which makes me, here
    and elsewhere, sure of that wherewith I link it.
    The world is certainly as wholly void
    of every virtue as thou tellest me,
    and is with evil big and overspread;
    but, pray, point out its cause, that I may see,
    and show it unto other men; for one
    puts it in heaven, another, here below.”

    At first he heaved a sigh profound, which grief
    to “Ah me!” changed; then “Brother,” he began,
    “the world is blind, and thou, indeed, com’st hence.
    Ye that are living still attribute upward
    each cause to heaven alone, as though it moved
    everything with it of necessity.
    If this were so, Free Will would be destroyed
    within you, and no justice would there be
    in having joy for good, and grief for ill.
    Heaven starts your inclinations, though I say
    not all; but ev’n supposing that I did,
    light has been giv’n to you for good and evil,

    with Free Will, which, if it endure fatigue
    in its first fights with heaven, will afterward,
    if duly nourished, conquer everything.
    Beneath a greater Power and better Nature
    ye freely lie; and that creates within you
    the mind, which heaven hath not in its control.
    Hence, if the present world go wrong, the cause
    is in yourselves, and should in you be sought;
    of this I ’ll now a true spy be for thee.

    Forth from the hand of Him, who ere it lives
    delights in it, ev’n like a little maid,
    who weeps and laughs, and wantons like a child,
    issues the simple soul, which knoweth nought,
    save that, proceeding from a Joyous Maker,
    it gladly turns to that which pleases it.
    At first it tasteth things of little good;
    deceived thereby, it runneth after them,
    unless a guide or check divert its love.
    Hence, as a bit, a law must needs be set;
    a king must needs be had, who should at least
    the tower of the truthful town discern.
    The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?
    No one; because the Shepherd who precedes
    can chew the cud, but hath not cloven hoofs;
    the people, hence, who see their guide strive solely
    for those good things for which it longs itself,
    feedeth thereon, and asks for nothing more.

    Well canst thou see that evil leadership,
    and not that Nature in you is corrupt,
    is what has caused the world to be so wicked.
    Rome, which once made it good, was wont to have
    two Suns, which rendered visible both roads,
    that of the world, and that of God. One now
    hath quenched the other; to the bishop’s staff
    the sword is joined, and badly needs must one
    fare with the other, since, together joined,
    neither the other fears; recall to mind,
    if thou believe me not, the ear of corn;
    for every grass is by its own seed known.
    Throughout the country watered by the Po
    and Adige, one used to find both virtue
    and courtesy, ere Frederick had his strife;
    with safety it can nowadays be crossed
    by any who, through shame, refrained from speech
    with good men, or avoided intercourse.
    There are, indeed, three old men still, in whom
    the old age chides the modern, and who long
    for God to give them back a better life:
    Corrado da Palazzo, good Gherardo,
    and Guido da Castello, better called,
    the simple Lombard, as in France he is.

    Say, therefore, that today the Church of Rome,
    by joining in herself two kinds of rule,
    falls in the mire, and fouls her self and load!”

    “O Marco mine,” said I, “thine arguments
    are good; and now I see why Levi’s sons
    were from inheriting debarred. But which
    Gherardo is the one, who, as thou sayst,
    as sample of the people now extinct,
    remaineth to reproach this savage age?”

    “Thy speech deceives or tests me,” he replied,
    “for, thou, addressing me in Tuscan speech,
    seemst not to know who good Gherardo was.
    I know him not by other added name,
    unless I took it from his daughter, Gaia.
    God keep you, for with you I come no further!
    Already whitening now, behold the light,
    which rays out through the smoke, and I must go —
    the Angel ’s there — ere I be seen by him.”

    He thus turned back, nor would he hear me more.

PURGATORIO XVII

Purgatory. The Third Ring. Anger

Instances of Punished Anger. The Angel of Peace. Love

    Reader, remind thyself, if e’er a fog
    o’ertook thee on a mountain, one through which
    thou couldst not see in any other way
    than moles do through the membrane o’er their eyes,
    how, when the damp, thick mists begin to thin,
    the sun’s orb feebly pierces them; and quickly
    will thine imagination come to see
    how I first saw the sun again, which now
    was at its setting. Thus, as I mine own
    was matching with my Teacher’s trusty steps,
    from such a cloud I came into the beams,
    already dead upon the shores below.

    O thou Imagination, which at times
    dost steal us so from outer things, that though
    a thousand trumpets blow, one hears them not,
    what moveth thee, if sense contribute naught?
    A light which takes in Heaven its form impels thee,
    freely, or by a Will which sends it down.

    The vision of her cruelty, who changed
    her form into the bird, which most delights
    in song, appeared in my imagination;

    and hereupon my mind was so shut up
    within itself, that nothing that was then
    received by it, came to it from without.

    Then into my high fantasy there rained
    one crucified, contemptuous and proud
    in aspect, and as such he met his death.
    Around him were the great Ahasuerus,
    Esther his wife, and righteous Mordecai,
    who so whole-hearted was in word and deed.

    And as this picture of its own accord
    broke up, as doth a bubble when it lacks
    the water it was formed withal; a maid
    rose in my vision next, who bitterly
    was weeping, and was saying: “Why, O Queen,
    didst thou through anger wish to be no more?”
    Lavinia not to lose, thyself hast slain;
    and now hast lost me! Mother, this is I,
    who, ere I mourn another’s loss, mourn thine.”

    As sleep is broken, when unwonted light
    strikes closed eyes suddenly, and, being broken,
    quivers before it wholly dies away;
    ev’n so did my imagining break up,
    as soon as on my face there smote a light
    brighter by far than we are wont to see.

    I turned around to notice where I was,
    when lo, a voice which said: “The ascent is here,”
    from every other interest turned my mind;

    and made my will so eager to behold
    the speaker, that, when such, it never rests
    until it sees its object face to face.
    But as before the sun, which whelms our eyes,
    and veils its figure, through excess of light,
    so likewise here my visual powers failed.

    “A godlike spirit this, who, though unasked,
    is pointing out to us our upward path,
    and with his own light is himself concealing.
    With us he deals as one would with himself;
    for he that waits till asked, when seeing need,
    inclines already meanly to refuse.
    To such a bidding let us now accord
    our feet, and try to climb ere darkness come;
    for later one could not, till day returned.”

    Thus said my Leader then, and I with him
    turned toward a flight of stairs our feet; and I,
    when on its first step, near me felt, as ’t were,
    the motion of a wing, and on my face
    a fanning, while a voice said: “Blessèd are
    the Peaceful, who are free from evil wrath!”

    So high above us now were those last beams
    which by the night are followed, that the stars
    were coming out on many sides. And “O
    my strength, why dost thou fade away so fast?”
    I to myself was saying, for a truce,
    I felt, was set the powers of my legs.

    We now were where the flight of stairs went up
    no further, and as motionless we were,
    as is a vessel when the shore is reached;
    and for a while I waited to find out
    if aught upon the new ring could be heard;
    then, toward my Teacher turning round, I said:
    “Say, my dear Father, what offense is purged
    in this ring, here where now we are? Although
    our feet keep still, let not thy talking cease.”

    And he to me: “The love of good, when scant
    of what it should have been, is here atoned;
    here beats again the ill-retarded oar.
    But now, in order that thou understand
    more clearly still, turn thou thy mind to me,
    and some good fruit thou ’lt gather from our stay.

    Neither Creator,” he began, “nor creature
    was e’er devoid of either innate love,
    or that which conscious is; and this thou knowst.

    The innate love is always free from error;
    but the other kind can err through evil aim,
    or through deficient, or excessive strength.
    While well directed toward the primal goods,
    and toward the secondary self-restrained,
    it cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;
    but when it turns toward evil things, or runs
    to good, with more or less zeal than it ought,
    the creature then against his Maker works.

    From this, then, thou canst understand that love
    must be the seed in you of every virtue,
    and every deed that merits punishment.

    And now, since love can never turn its face
    from its own subject’s welfare, from self-hate
    all are secure; and since one cannot think
    of any self as being from the First
    divided, and existing of itself,
    all hearts are thus debarred from hating Him.
    It follows, that, if I in arguing
    judge well, one’s neighbor’s is the harm one loves,
    and this is born in three ways in your clay.

    There ’s he, who on the abasement of his neighbor
    his hope of rising sets, and only longs
    that from his greatness he may be brought low;
    and he, who fears the loss of power, favor,
    renown and honor, should another rise,
    and grieves so, that he loves the contrary;
    then he, who by injustice seems so shamed,
    that greedy he becometh for revenge;
    and such must needs prepare for others’ harm.
    This triform love is wept for here below;
    but now I ’d have thee hear about the other,
    which runs to love in a corrupted way.

    All apprehend confusedly a good
    wherein the mind can rest, and long for it;
    and therefore every one attempts to reach it.

    If slothful be the love impelling you
    to see or win it, after just repentance,
    this present cornice tortures you for that.

    Another good there is, which never makes
    man happy; it is not real happiness,
    nor the Good Essence, fruit and root of all
    that ’s good. The love that yields too much to that,
    is wept for in three rings above us here;
    but why it ’s reckoned threefold I say not,
    that thou mayst seek the reason for thyself.”

PURGATORIO XVIII

    The lofty Doctor, having ended thus
    his argument, was looking in my eyes,
    eager to see if I seemed satisfied;
    and I, who by new thirst was still spurred on,
    was silent outwardly, and in me said:
    “My many questions trouble him perhaps;”
    but that true Father, who perceived the wish,
    which, being shy, did not disclose itself,
    by speaking first, emboldened me to speak.

    Hence I: “My vision, Teacher, in thy light
    becomes so keen, that clearly I discern
    all that thy talk implieth or unfolds;
    I therefore beg of thee, sweet Father dear,
    explain to me why thou ascrib’st to love
    every good action and its contrary.”

    “Direct thine understanding’s sharpened eyes
    toward me,” he said, “and clear to thee will be
    the error of the blind who pose as guides.
    The mind, which is created prone to love,
    inclines toward everything that pleases it,
    when roused by pleasure to activity.

    Your faculty of apprehending draws
    an image from reality, and so
    displays it in you, that your mind is caused
    to turn to it; and if, thus turned, your mind
    inclines thereto, that tendency is love,
    is nature bound in you again by pleasure.
    Then, just as fire, by reason of its form,
    moves upward, being made for mounting thither,
    where, in its element, it longer lasts;
    ev’n so the captive mind begins to yearn,
    (a motion of the soul) and never rests
    until the thing it loveth gives it joy.
    Apparent to thee now can be the extent
    to which the truth is hid from those that claim
    that each love in itself deserveth praise,
    because, perhaps, its object in itself
    seems always to be good; and yet not good
    is every seal, though good may be its wax.”

    “Thy words, together with my heeding mind,”
    I answered him, “have shown me what love is;
    but this hath made me bigger with a doubt;
    for, if love from without is born in us,
    and if the soul can do naught else, her doing
    or right or wrong, is no desert of hers.”

    And he: “What Reason sees here I can tell thee;
    for aught beyond its ken, look thou alone
    to Beatrice, for that ’s a work of Faith.

    Every substantial form which is distinct
    from matter, and is also joined with it,
    hath in it a specific power collected,
    which, save in operation, is not seen,
    and only shows itself in its effects,
    as life doth, by its green leaves, in a plant.
    None knows, however, whence the understanding
    of first cognitions comes, or whence the bent
    toward those first appetites which are in you,
    as zeal for making honey is in bees;
    this first will, hence, deserves nor praise nor blame.
    Now, that all others be conformed to this,
    the power which counsels inborn is in you,
    and ought to hold the threshold of assent.
    This is the source, whence comes the ground
    of merit in you, as it gathers in,
    and winnows out, your good and guilty loves.
    Those who in reasoning attained the bottom,
    perceived this inborn liberty, and left
    the world the teachings of morality.
    Supposing, then, that every love that flames
    within you, rises of necessity,
    within you lies the power to master it.
    This noble virtue is by Beatrice
    called Freedom of the Will; hence see that thou
    recall it, should she speak of it to thee.”
            
    The moon, in rising, close to midnight late,
    and looking like a bucket all on fire,
    was causing now the stars to seem more rare;
    as, counter to the heavens, it coursed the paths
    the sun enflames, whene’er the Roman sees it
    setting between the Sards and Corsicans;
    and now that noble shade, whence Piètola
    hath greater fame than any Mantuan village,
    had put aside the load I laid on him;
    hence I who, as an answer to my questions,
    had reaped his clear and easy talk, remained
    like one confused because of drowsiness.

    But suddenly this sleepiness of mine
    was taken from me by a crowd of people,
    who, back of us, were circling toward us now.
    And as Ismenus and Asopus once
    along their banks saw maddened throngs at night,
    whene’er the Thebans needed Bacchus; such
    were those who, sweeping scythe-like round that ring,
    were coming on, from what I saw of them,
    by good will ridden and by righteous love.

    And soon were they upon us, for the whole
    of that great crowd was moving at a run;
    and two ahead in tears were crying out:
    “Mary proceeded to the hills in haste,” and “Caesar,
    in order to subdue Ilerda, struck
    Marseilles, then hurried on to Spain.”

    “Quick, quick, lest time be lost through lack of love,”
    cried those that came behind them, “so that zeal
    in doing good may make Grace green again!”

    “O folk, in whom keen fervor now redeems,
    perhaps, the negligence and slowness shown
    by your tepidity in doing good,
    this man who lives, and truly I lie not,
    desires, when sunlight once returns, to mount;
    hence tell us where the nearest opening lies.”

    These were my Leader’s words; and one of those
    same spirits said: “Come on behind us, then,
    and thou wilt find the hole. So keen we are
    to keep on moving, that we cannot stop;
    forgive us, then, if lack of courtesy
    thou deem, what we consider righteousness.
    I was San Zeno’s Abbot at Verona,
    under the rule of worthy Barbarossa,
    of whom Milàn in sorrow talketh still.
    And he has one foot in the grave already,
    who soon will for that monastery weep,
    and grieve because he had it in his power;
    for he his son, in body wholly sick,
    worse still in mind, and also ill-begot,
    has had installed in its true shepherd’s place.”

    I know not if aught else he said, or ceased,
    so far had he run past us now; but this
    I heard, and I’ve enjoyed retaining it.

    Then he who was my help in every need,
    said: “Turn in this direction, and behold
    two coming on, who give a bite to sloth.”

    Moving behind them all, they said: “The folk,
    for whom the sea was opened up, were dead,
    before the Jordan had perceived their heirs;
    and those who with the son of Anchises
    could not endure to toil unto the end,
    gave themselves up to lead inglorious lives.”

    Then, when those shades were separated from us
    so far, that they no longer could be seen,
    a new thought made its way into my mind,
    whence many other different thoughts were born;
    and I between them so confused became,
    that, wandering to and fro, I closed mine eyes,
    and changed what I had thought into a dream.

PURGATORIO XIX

Purgatory. The Fourth Ring. Sloth. Dante’s Second Dream

The Angel of Zeal. The Fifth Ring. Avarice and Prodigality

    Within the hour, when, vanquished by the earth,
    or ev’n at times by Saturn, day-time’s heat
    can warm the coldness of the moon no longer;
    when geomancers see their Greater Fortune
    rise in the East ere dawn, and on a path
    which doth not long stay dark for it; a Female
    approached me in a dream, with stammering tongue,
    with eyes asquint, and crooked on her feet,
    with hands lopped off, and pallor on her face.

    I fixed my gaze on her; and as the sun
    brings comfort to cold limbs which night-time chills,
    ev’n so my looking at her freed her tongue,
    and afterward, in but a little time,
    completely straightened her, and gave that hue
    to her discolored face which love desires.

    As soon as she had thus unloosed her speech,
    she then began to sing in such a way,
    that from her I could hardly take my gaze.
    “I am” she sang, “the lovely Siren, she
    who in mid-ocean mariners bewitches;
    so much I please whoever heareth me!

    I turned Ulysses from his wandering course
    to hear my song; and who gets used to me
    seldom departs, so wholly I content him!”

    Her mouth had not yet closed, when lo,
    a holy Lady at my side appeared,
    who ready was to put her to confusion.
    “O Virgil, Virgil, who is this?” she cried
    in scornful tones; whereat he then advanced
    with eyes set only on the modest one.
    She seized the other, opened her in front,
    and rent her garments, showing me her belly;
    this woke me with the stench that issued from it.

    I turned my eyes, and my good Teacher said:
    “I ’ve called thee thrice at least. Arise and come.
    We’ ll find the gate through which thou mayst ascend.”

    I rose, and all the holy Mountain’s rings
    were with the high day’s light already filled,
    as with the new sun back of us we moved.

    While I was following him, I held my head
    like one who, having it bowed down by thought,
    makes of himself a half-arch of a bridge;
    and then I heard: “Come on; the pass is here,”
    uttered in such a gentle, kindly way,
    as in this mortal land is never heard.

    With outspread wings, which seemed the wings of swans,
    he who thus spoke directed us on high
    ’tween the two side walls of the granite rock.

    He moved his pinions then, and fanning us,
    affirmed that “those who mourn” are happy, since
    possessed of comfort shall their spirits be.

    “What aileth thee, that only on the ground
    thou gazest?” said my Guide, when past the Angel
    both he and I had climbed a little way.

    And I: “A recent dream, which to itself
    inclines me, makes me with such doubt advance,
    that I cannot refrain from thought of it.”

    “Thou hast perceived” said he, “that ancient witch
    who henceforth o’er us is alone lamented;
    and seen how from her one is freed. Let that
    suffice thee; strike thy heels upon the ground,
    and turn thine eyes up toward the calling lure
    the Eternal King whirls with the mighty wheels!”

    As is the falcon, which at first looks down,
    then turns around when called, and spreads his wings,
    keen for the quarry which attracts him; such
    was I; and thus, as long as e’er the rock
    was cleft, to make a path for those that climb,
    I went along to where the circling starts.

    When out upon the fifth ring I had come,
    people therein I saw who, shedding tears,
    were lying wholly prone upon its bed.
    “My soul hath cloven to the trodden ground!”
    I heard them saying with such heavy sighs,
    that what they said could hardly be made out.

    “O ye elect of God, whose sufferings here
    Justice and hope are making less intense,
    direct us toward the steps that lead on high!”

    “If ye are come exempt from lying down,
    and wish to find the path with greatest speed,
    let your right sides be always outward turned.”

    Thus asked the Poet, and, not far ahead,
    thus was the answer giv’n; hence, as he spoke,
    I noticed where the other speaker hid,
    and then I turned mine eyes unto my Lord;
    whereat he granted with a cheerful nod
    that which the looks of my desiring asked.

    When I was free to act as I inclined,
    I came and stood above the soul, whose words
    had made me notice him at first, and said:
    “Spirit, who by thy tears art ripening that,
    without which one can not return to God,
    for my sake stay a while thy greater care.
    Say who thou wast, why ye hold up your backs,
    and whether thou wouldst have me get thee aught
    from there, whence I, a living man, set forth.”

    And he to me: “Why toward itself the sky
    is turning here our backs, thou ’lt know; but, first,
    know thou that I once sat in Peter’s chair.
    ’Tween Sièstri and Chiaveri there descends
    a lovely mountain stream, and from its name
    my race’s title takes its greatest boast.

    For one month and a little more I felt
    how much the mighty Mantle weights on him
    who keeps it from the mire; for all loads else
    seem feathers. My conversion was, alas!
    delayed; but when Rome’s Shepherd I was made,
    I came to know how false the world’s life was.
    I saw that in it hearts can find no rest;
    nor could one in it higher rise than I;
    the love of this life, hence, was kindled in me.
    Till that time I had been a wretched soul,
    cut off from God, and wholly giv’n to greed;
    now, as thou see’st, I’m punished for it here.
    What avarice doth is here made manifest,
    in this purgation of converted souls;
    nor hath this Mount a penalty more bitter.
    And as our eyes were never upward turned,
    because intently fixed on earthly things,
    so Justice here hath turned them to the ground.
    As avarice quenched our love for all good things,
    until well doing had completely ceased,
    so here doth Justice hold us in restraint,
    bound fast and fettered in our hands and feet;
    and here we ’ll stay, stretched out and motionless
    as long as it shall please the Righteous Lord.”

    I had knelt down, and wished to speak; but just
    as I began, and he was made aware,
    by listening only, of my reverence,

    “What cause” said he, “hath bent thee downward thus?”
    And I to him: “Because of your high rank
    my conscience troubled me for standing up.”

    “Straighten thy legs, my brother,” he replied,
    “and rise! Err not! With thee and with the rest
    a fellow-servant of one Power am I.
    If thou hast ever fully understood
    those holy Gospel words: ‘They neither marry,’
    well canst thou see why I am speaking thus.
    And now begone! I ’d have thee stay no more;
    for, lingering here, thou hinderest the tears,
    wherewith I ripen that which thou hast said.
    A niece I have up yonder called Alàgia,
    good in herself, so be it that our house
    by its example do not make her bad;
    and she is all that ’s left to me up there”

    A will fights weakly ’gainst a stronger will;
    hence I, myself displeasing, him to please,
    out of the water drew my sponge unfilled.

    I started; and along the space left clear
    close to the rocky cliff my Leader moved,
    as ’neath its battlements one hugs a wall;
    for those who through their eyes pour drop by drop
    the evil which pervadeth all the world,
    approach too closely to the outer edge.

    Be thou accurst, thou ancient Wolf, that prey
    far greater hast than have all other beasts,
    by reason of thy hunger’s endless depth!
    O Heaven, through whose revolving, some, it seems,
    believe that here below conditions change,
    when will he come, through whom this beast shall leave?

    As on we went with slow and scanted steps,
    and I was listening to the shades I heard
    weeping and uttering piteous lamentations;
    by chance I heard in front of us a voice
    cry out ‘Sweet Mary!’ in the tearful tones
    wherewith a woman cries in childbirth’s pangs;

    and this was followed by: “As poor thou wast,
    as by the hostelry may be perceived,
    where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.”

    Next after this I heard: “O good Fabricius,
    with virtue thou didst poverty prefer
    to great possessions with iniquity.”

    So pleasing had these last words been to me,
    that further on I moved, that I might know
    the spirit from whose lips they seemed to come.
    He now was speaking of the generous gift
    bestowed by Nicholas upon the maids,
    to guide their youth into an honored path.

    “O soul, that speakest of such worthy deeds,
    say who thou wast,” said I, “and why alone
    thou thus renewest this deservèd praise.
    Thy words will not remain without reward,
    if I return to end that life’s short course,
    which flieth onward toward its final term.”

    And he: “I ’ll tell it thee, though not for help
    that I may look for yonder, but because
    Grace shines so brightly in thee, ere thy death.
    I was the root of that malignant plant,
    whose shadow darkens all the Christian land,
    so that good fruit is seldom picked from it.
    But if Douai, Lille, Ghent, and Bruges could,
    vengeance would soon be wrought for this; and I
    of Him request it, who is Judge of all.

    Yonder my name was Hugh Capet; from me
    have sprung the Philips and the Louises,
    who have in recent ages governed France.
    A Paris butcher’s son I was; when all
    the ancient kings had passed away, save one,
    a gray-robed monk, tight in my hands I found
    the bridle of the kingdom’s government,
    with so much power of recent gain, and such
    a host of friends, that to the widowed crown
    was raised the head of mine own son, with whom
    the line of their anointed bones began.
    As long as its great dowry of Provence
    had not deprived my family of shame,
    its worth was small, but still it did no harm.
    With that began its thefts by force and fraud;
    for afterward, to make amends, Ponthieu
    it seized, with Normandy and Gascony.
    Charles came to Italy; and there, to make
    amends, a victim made of Conradin; and then,
    to make amends, drove Thomas back to Heaven.
    A time I see, not very long from now,
    which out of France will bring another Charles,
    to make both him and his the better known.
    He issues thence alone and with no host,
    but with the jousting lance of Judas; this
    he thrusts so, that he bursts the paunch of Florence.

    As a result not land, but sin and shame
    he ’ll win, of so much greater weight for him,
    the lighter he accounts such loss. I see
    the other Charles, once captured from his ship,
    his daughter sell, and haggle for the price,
    as corsairs do with slave-girls not their own.
    What more, O Avarice, canst thou do with us,
    since thou hast to thyself so drawn my race,
    that ev’n for its own flesh it careth not?
    That future ills and past ones may seem less,
    I see Alagna by the Lily entered,
    and, in his Vicar, Christ a prisoner made.
    I see the latter mocked a second time;
    I see the vinegar and gall renewed,
    and Him I see ’mong living robbers killed.
    And this new Pilate I behold so ruthless,
    that, not content with this, he lawlessly
    into the Temple bears his greedy sails.
    Oh, when, my Lord, shall I rejoice to see
    the vengeance, in Thy secret counsel hid,
    which now avails to make Thine anger sweet?
    What of the Holy Spirit’s only Bride
    I said just now, and thereby made thee turn
    to me for explanation, serves as answer
    to all our prayers, as long as daylight lasts;
    but soon as night returns, instead of these,
    we utter words which sound the opposite.

    We thereupon rehearse Pygmalion’s story,
    and how of him his greedy lust for gold
    a traitor made, a thief, and parricide;
    and avaricious Midas’ misery,
    which followed from his covetous request,
    and at which one will always have to laugh.
    Next, foolish Achan every one recalls,
    who stole the plunder, so that even here
    the wrath of Joshua seems to bite him still.
    We then accuse Sapphira with her husband;
    we praise the kicks which Heliodorus got;
    while Polymnestor circles all the Mount
    in infamy, who Polydorus killed;
    and finally, our cry is: ‘Tell us, Crassus,
    for thou dost know it, what ’s the taste of gold?’
    Aloud at times speaks one, another low,
    as each one’s feelings spur him on to speak,
    in stronger now, and now in weaker tones;
    hence I, in speaking of the good, which here
    is talked about by day, was not alone;
    but near us here none other spoke aloud.”

    Already had we gone away from him,
    striving to make our way along the path
    as fast as was allowed our powers; when I,
    like something falling, felt the Mountain quake;
    then such a chill took hold of me, as he
    is wont to have who goeth to his death.

    Delos, indeed, shook not so terribly,
    before Latona made therein her nest,
    in order to give birth to heaven’s two eyes.

    Then such a cry arose on every side,
    that close to me my Teacher drew, and said:
    “Be not afraid, while I am guiding thee!”
    “Glory to God” they all said, “in the highest,”
    as far as I could understand from those near by,
    where what was being shouted could be heard.
    Both motionless and in suspense we stood,
    as stood the shepherds who first heard that song,
    till, when the trembling stopped, the shouting ceased.

    Thereafter we resumed our holy journey,
    watching the shades that lay upon the ground,
    returned already to their wonted plaint.
    No ignorance had ever with as great
    anxiety made me desire to know,
    unless in this my memory go astray,
    as that which, as I thought, I seemed to have;
    I neither dared to ask, because of haste,
    nor could I see there anything myself;
    so on I went, timid and lost in thought.

PURGATORIO XXI

Purgatory. The Fifth Ring. Avarice and Prodigality

Statius. The Cause of the Earthquake

    The natural thirst, which never can be quenched,
    save by the water asked for by the lowly
    young woman of Samaria as a boon,
    was troubling me, while hurry spurred me on
    behind my Leader o’er the cumbered path,
    and I was grieving for the just revenge.

    Then lo, as Luke records for us that Christ,
    when risen from the burial cave, appeared
    before the two upon the road, a shade
    appeared, and came behind us as we watched
    the crowd, which lay around us at our feet;
    but we perceived him not; hence he spoke first,
    and said: “May God, my brethren, give you peace!”

    We turned at once, and to this greeting Virgil
    replied with that which corresponds to it.
    Then he began: “Within the blest assembly
    mayst thou be set at peace by that just court
    which in eternal exile bindeth me.”

    “What!” he replied, as quickly on we went,
    “If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,
    who guided you so far along His stairs?”

    My Teacher then: “If thou regard the marks
    which this one bears, and which the Angel draws,
    thou ’lt see that with the good he needs must reign.
    But whereas she, who spinneth night and day,
    had not as yet drawn off for him the flax,
    which Clotho lays and packs for every one,
    his soul, which sister is to thee and me,
    could not, in climbing here, come up alone,
    because it seeth not as we. Hence I
    out of the ample throat of Hell was drawn,
    to show the way to him, and I shall show it,
    as far as e’er my school can lead him on.
    But tell us, if thou knowest, why the Mountain
    shook so just now, and why all seemed to shout
    with one accord down to its oozy base?”

    Thus by his asking he had threaded so
    the needle’s eye of my desire, that, merely
    with hope, my thirst had come to be less craving.

    The former then began: “Nothing exists
    which this Mount’s sacred government can feel,
    that void of order is, or ’gainst its wont.
    From every change this place up here is free;
    whate’er Heaven’s self from its own self receives,
    can be the cause of it, and nothing else;
    for neither rain, nor hail, nor snow, nor dew,
    nor frost falls any higher up than lies
    the little stairway of the three short steps;

    clouds neither dense or rarefied appear,
    nor lightning flashes, nor yet Thaumas’ daughter,
    who often changes quarter in the world.
    Dry vapor goes no higher than the top
    of those three steps whereof I spoke to thee,
    and on which Peter’s vicar hath his feet.
    Below, perhaps, it trembles more or less,
    but never quakes up here because of wind
    concealed, I know not how, inside the earth.
    It trembles here whenever any soul
    feels pure enough to rise, or starts to climb;
    and such a cry as this endorses it.
    Of purity the will alone gives proof,
    which, seizing on the soul, now wholly free
    to change its company, by willing helps it.
    It wills this from the first; but that desire
    which, ’gainst the will, God’s Justice turns toward pain,
    as it was once toward sin, allows it not.
    And I, who have five hundred years and more
    lain in this woe, felt only now within me
    a free volition for a better sphere.
    That ’s why thou didst the earthquake feel, and hear
    the pious spirits on this Mountain praise
    that Lord, who soon, I pray, will send them up.”

    He thus addressed us; and, since one in drink
    delights, according as his thirst is great,
    I could not say how much he did me good.

    And my wise Leader: “Now I see the net
    which holds you here, and how it opens, why
    it trembles here, and why ye all rejoice.
    Now who thou wast be pleased to let me know,
    and also let thy words include for me
    why thou hast lain so many centuries here.”

    “At that time when, helped by the Most High King,
    good Titus took due vengeance for the wounds,
    from which came forth the blood by Judas sold,
    I was in great renown” that spirit said,
    “up yonder with the name which longest lasts,
    and honors most, but not as yet with faith.
    So sweet my song, that, though a Toulousan,
    Rome drew me to herself, where I deserved
    to have my temples crowned with myrtle wreath.
    Statius they call me still up there; of Thebes
    I sang, of great Achilles next; but ’neath
    this second load I sank upon the way.
    The seeds of my enthusiasm were the sparks,
    which warmed me, of that fire divine, wherewith
    more than a thousand poets are enflamed;
    I mean the Aeneid, which my mother was
    and nurse in poetry; and, lacking which,
    not by a drachm’s weight had I stirred the scales.
    And to have lived on earth when Virgil lived,
    to one sun’s period more would I consent
    than what I owe, to issue from my ban.”

    These words turned Virgil toward me with a look,
    which, silently, “Be silent!” said; and yet
    the power that wills can not do everything;
    for tears and laughter follow so the passion,
    from which they each take rise, that least of all
    do they obey the will in those most truthful.
    I only smiled, like one who winks; whereat
    the shade kept still, and looked into my eyes,
    wherein expression is most fixed, and said:
    “So mayst thou bring unto a happy end
    so great a toil, why was it that thy face
    showed me just now the flashing of a smile?”

    I now am caught on one side and the other;
    one asks for silence, the other conjures me
    to speak; I therefore sigh, and by my Teacher
    am understood. “Be not afraid to talk,”
    the latter said to me, “but speak, and tell him
    what he so eagerly desires to know.”

    I therefore said: “Perhaps thou marvellest,
    O ancient spirit, at the smile I gave;
    but I would have still greater wonder seize thee.
    This spirit here, who upward leads mine eyes,
    that Virgil is, from whom thou didst of old
    derive the strength to sing of men and gods.
    If thou hast given my smile some other cause,
    leave it as not the true one, and believe
    it was the words thyself didst say of him.”

    Already was he stooping to embrace
    my Teacher’s feet; but he said: “Brother, no;
    for thou, a shade now, dost a shade behold.”

    Rising, he said: “Thou now canst understand
    the sum of love which warmeth me toward thee,
    since I forget our disembodied state,
    and act with shades as if they solid were.”

PURGATORIO XXII

Purgatory. Statius. The Angel of Justice

The Sixth Ring. Gluttony. Instances of Temperance

    Already was the Angel left behind,
    the Angel who had toward the sixth ring turned us,
    after erasing from my face a wound;
    and he had said to us that those are blest,
    whose longing is for justice, and his words,
    with nothing further, ended this with “thirst.”

    Hence, lighter now than at the other passes,
    I so advanced, that I, without fatigue,
    was following up the spirits who were swift,
    when Virgil thus began: “A love that flames,
    by virtue kindled, always lights another,
    if but its flame be outwardly revealed.
    And therefore from the hour when Juvenal,
    who let me know thy love for me, came down
    among us in the Borderland of Hell,
    my good will hath been such toward thee, that none
    e’er bound me more to one I had not seen;
    these stairs will, therefore, now seem short to me.
    But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,
    if too great confidence relax my rein,
    and as a friend converse with me henceforth:

    how was it avarice could find a place
    within thy breast together with such wisdom,
    as that wherewith thou by thy zeal wast filled?”

    At first these words made Statius smile a little;
    and then he answered: “Every word of thine
    is of thy love for me a precious proof.
    Things, of a truth, quite frequently appear,
    which offer one false arguments for doubt,
    because their real occasions are concealed.
    Thy question makes me sure of thy belief,
    due, maybe, to the ring where I was found,
    that I was in the last life avaricious.
    Know, then, that avarice was too far from me,
    and that this lack of temperance on my part
    thousands of courses of the moon have punished.
    And were it not that I corrected me,
    when I had understood thee in thy cry,
    indignant, as it were, with human nature:
    ‘Why dost thou not, O virtuous love of gold,
    govern the appetite of mortal men?’
    I ’d now, by rolling, feel the wretched jousts.
    I then perceived that hands could ope their wings
    too much in spending, and repented me
    of that, as well as of my other sins.
    How many from the grave shall hairless rise
    through ignorance which, in life and at the last,
    deprives them of repentance for this fault!

    Know, too, that any fault which of a sin
    is just the opposite, together with it
    drieth its green leaves here. If, therefore, I,
    to purge myself, have been among the folk
    who avarice bewail, to me it happened
    because of what was contrary thereto.”

    “When thou didst sing, then, of the cruel strife
    between the two afflictions of Jocasta,”
    said he who sang bucolic songs, “by that
    which Clio singeth with thee there, the faith,
    without which doing good is not enough,
    had not, it seems, yet made thee a believer.
    If this be so, what sun, or else what candles
    lightened thy darkness so, that thou thereafter
    didst set thy sails behind the Fisherman?”

    “Thou first didst send me to Parnassus’ slopes
    to drink,” he said to him, “and then the first
    thou wast, who, next to God, illumined me.
    Thou didst like him, who, when he walks by night,
    a light behind him bears nor helps himself,
    but maketh those that follow after see,
    when thou didst say: ‘The age renews itself;
    Justice returns, and man’s primeval times,
    as down from Heaven a new-born race descends.’
    Through thee a poet I became, through thee
    a Christian! But, that thou mayst better see
    my sketch, I ’ll set my hand to color it.

    Pregnant already with the true belief,
    sowed by the eternal Kingdom’s messengers,
    was every portion of the whole wide world;
    and now thy words, to which I ’ve just referred,
    with these new preachers harmonized so well,
    that I became accustomed to frequent them.
    Thereat so holy did they come to seem,
    that when Domitian persecuted them,
    their lamentations did not lack my tears;
    and while I still remained in yonder world,
    I helped them; and their upright mode of life
    caused me to treat with scorn all other sects.
    And ere in poetry I led the Greeks
    to see the streams of Thebes, baptized I was;
    and yet, through fear, a secret Christian only,
    I long pretended faith in paganism;
    this lukewarmness around the fourth ring moved me
    till far beyond the fourth centennial year.
    Thou, therefore, that didst lift the covering veil
    which hid from me the good whereof I speak,
    tell me, while we have still a little more
    to climb, where our old Terence is, and where
    Cecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou know;
    tell me if they are damned, and in what ward.”

    “Both they and Persius, I and many others”
    my Leader answered him, “are with the Greek,
    whom more than any else the Muses nursed,

    in the first circle of the sightless Prison;
    and frequently we talk about the mount,
    which always hath our nurses on its slopes.
    Euripides and Antiphon are there
    with us, Simonides and Agathon,
    and many other Greeks, who once adorned
    their brows with laurel. There, of thine own folk,
    Antigone is seen, Deìphile,
    Argìa, and, as sad as once, Ismène.
    There, too, may she be seen, who showed Langìa;
    there is Tiresias’ daughter, Thetis also,
    and with her sisters there, Deidamìa.”

    And now the Poets, both of them, were silent,
    intent again on looking round, since free
    from climbing up and free from walls; and while
    four handmaids of the day had dropped behind,
    the fifth was at the sun-car’s pole, still upward
    pointing its burning horn; whereat my Leader:
    “I think that it behooves us now to turn
    our right sides toward the outer edge, and circle
    the Mountain as our wont it is to do.”

    Thus was our custom our instructor there;
    and with less doubt we started on again,
    because of that deserving soul’s assent.
    In front they went, and I behind, alone,
    listening the while to what they had to say,
    which gave me understanding for my verse.

    But soon their pleasant talk a Tree broke off,
    which in the middle of the road we found,
    with fruit agreeable and sweet to smell;
    and as a fir-tree tapers up from branch
    to branch, so likewise this one tapered down,
    in order, I believe, that none may climb it.
    And on the side on which our path was closed,
    down from the lofty cliff a limpid stream
    was falling, and spraying upward o’er its leaves.

    Then toward the Tree the two Bards turned their steps;
    and from among its leaves a voice cried out:
    “Of this food there will be for you a dearth!”
    Then: “More did Mary think of honoring,
    the marriage feast, and making it complete,
    than of her mouth, which pleadeth now for you;
    the ancient Roman women were content
    with water for their only drink; and Daniel
    thought little of his food, but wisdom gained.
    The primal age was beautiful as gold;
    with hunger it made acorns sweet to taste,
    and nectar every little brook, with thirst.
    Honey and flying locusts were the food
    which fed the Baptist in the wilderness;
    hence he is now as glorious and as great,
    as by the Gospel is revealed to you.”

PURGATORIO XXIII

Purgatory. The Sixth Ring. Gluttony

The Punishment of Gluttons. Forese Donati

    While I, as likewise he is wont to do,
    who wastes his life in hunting little birds,
    was piercing thus the green leaves with mine eyes,
    my more than Father said to me: “My son,
    come on now, for the time assigned to us
    should be more usefully distributed.”
    I turned my face, and, no less soon, my steps
    behind the Sages, who so talked, that walking
    they caused to be of no expense to me.

    Then lo, in tearful and in singing tones
    “My lips, O Lord” was heard in such a way,
    that to delight and sorrow it gave birth.

    “O gentle Father, what is that I hear?”
    said I; and he then: “Shades who, moving on,
    loosen, perhaps, the knot of what they owe.”

    As pilgrim travellers do, who lost in thought,
    on meeting unknown people on the road,
    turn round to look at them, but do not stop;
    ev’n so behind us, though more quickly moving,
    there came a band of souls, who as they passed,
    devout and silent, gazed at us in wonder.

    Each was expressionless and hollow-eyed,
    pale in his face, and lacking so in flesh,
    that of his bones his skin assumed the shape.
    I do not think that even Erysìchthon
    became so withered into utter skin,
    because of fasting, when he feared it most.

    Thinking within myself, I said: “Behold
    the people who once lost Jerusalem,
    when Mary thrust her beak into her son!”
    The sockets of their eyes seemed gemless rings;
    and he that OMO reads in human faces,
    would surely there have recognized the M.
    Who would believe the perfume of a fruit
    and odor of a water could so act,
    and cause such craving, if he knew not how?

    I still was wondering what so famished them,
    because the reason of their being lean,
    and of their wretched scurf was not yet clear;
    when lo, a shade from deep within his head
    turning his eyes toward me, looked hard, and then
    cried out aloud: “What grace is this to me?”

    I never should have known him by his face;
    but that to me was in his voice revealed,
    which in itself his aspect had suppressed.
    That spark rekindled all that I had known
    of that disfigured countenance, and thus
    I recognized it as Forese’s face.

    “Ah, prithee, heed thou not the dried up scab,”
    he pleaded, “which discolors thus my skin,
    nor any lack of flesh that I may have!
    But tell the truth about thyself, and who
    those two souls are, who bear thee company;
    refrain no longer from addressing me.”

    I answered him: “Thy face, which once as dead
    I mourned for, gives me now no smaller cause
    for weeping, that I see it so disfigured.
    For God’s sake tell me, then, what strips you thus;
    make me not talk and wonder, too; for ill
    can he converse, who longs for something else.”

    “A virtue from the Eternal Will” he said,
    “comes down into the water and the Tree
    we left behind, whereby I thus grow lean.
    And all these people who in tears are singing,
    because of following unchecked love of food,
    are here resanctified in thirst and hunger.
    The pleasant odor, issuing from the fruit,
    and from the spray which o’er the verdure spreads,
    kindles in us the wish to eat and drink.
    And not once only is our pain renewed,
    as on this floor we move around — our pain,
    I say, though solace ought to be my word;
    for to the Tree doth that same longing lead us,
    which once led Christ in happiness to cry:
    ‘My God!’, when with His blood He set us free.”

    And I to him: “Forese, from the day,
    when thou didst for a better life change world,
    five years have not yet rolled away till now.
    If power of sinning further ended in thee
    before the coming of that happy hour
    of sorrow, which reweddeth us to God,
    how is it thou art come up here? I thought
    that I should find thee still below, down there,
    where time restores itself by means of time.”

    Whence he to me: “My Nella, with the tears
    which streamed from her, enabled me to drink
    the pleasant wormwood of this pain so soon.
    She, with her pious prayers and with her sighs,
    hath drawn me from the hillside where one waits,
    and freed me from the other lower rings.
    So much the dearer a delight to God
    is my poor widow whom I loved so much,
    the more alone she is in doing right;
    for far more modest in its women is
    the wild Barbagia region of Sardinia,
    than the Barbagia which I left her in.
    O my dear brother, what wouldst have me say?
    I have, e’en now, a future time in sight,
    to which this hour will not be very old,
    when from the pulpit shameless Florence women
    will be prohibited to go abroad
    showing their bosoms with the breasts exposed.

    What Barbary women, or what Saracens
    e’er needed spiritual or other laws,
    to keep them covered up when going out?
    But if the shameless ones were sure of what
    a swiftly moving heaven prepares for them,
    their mouths for howling would be open now;
    for, if my foresight here deceive me not,
    they ’ll grieve, ere that one’s cheek grows hair, who still
    is hushed with lullabies. Now, brother, see,
    I pray, that from me thou no longer hide!
    Thou seèst that not only I, but all
    these people gaze where thou dost veil the sun.”

    Hence I to him: “If thou recall to mind
    what thou with me wast once, and with thee I,
    still grievous will our present memory be.
    Who goes before me turned me from that life
    the other day, when that one’s sister round
    was seen by you;” (and at the sun I pointed).
    “Through the deep night hath he conducted me,
    and from among the truly dead, still clothed
    in this real flesh, which follows in his steps.
    Thence his encouragements have drawn me on,
    as up I climbed, and circled round the Mount,
    which straightens you whom crooked made the world.
    He says that he will make me his companion,
    till there I am, where Beatrice shall be;
    up there without him must I needs remain.

    Virgil is he, who tells me so,” (at him
    I pointed), “and this other one, the shade,
    because of whom just now on every slope
    your Realm, which from itself removes him, quaked.”

    Speaking slowed not our gait, nor did our gait
    our speaking; but, still talking, we went on
    apace, as, by a fair wind driv’n, a ship.
    The shades, meanwhile, who looked like things twice dead,
    drew wonder through their hollowed eyes at me,
    when they perceived that I was still alive.

    And I, continuing my talking, said:
    “He, for another’s sake, is going up
    more slowly than, perhaps, he else would do.
    But, if thou know, say where Piccarda is;
    and whether I see any here worth noting
    among these people who so gaze at me.”

    “My sister who, ’tween fair and good, was most
    I know not which, on high Olympus triumphs,
    happy already in the crown she wears.”

    This he said first, and then: “We ’re not forbid
    to name each here, since by our abstinence,
    our aspects are so greatly milked away.
    This Bonagiunta is,” his finger showed him,
    “the Lucca Bonagiunta; while the face
    beyond him, more embroidered than the rest,

    had in his arms the Holy Church; of Tours
    he was, and now, by fasting, expiates
    Bolsena’s eels and rare vernaccia wine.”

    And many more he named me, one by one;
    and all, when named, seemed satisfied, hence I,
    because of this, saw not a gloomy act.

    Using their teeth through hunger, though in vain,
    I saw both Ubaldino della Pila,
    and Boniface, who pastured with his crook
    much folk. I Ser Marchese saw, who once
    had time to drink less dryly at Forlì,
    yet such he was, that he did not feel sated.

    But, as one looks, and more of one man thinks
    than of another, so did I at him
    of Lucca, who, it seemed, most wished to know me.
    He murmured, and I heard I know not what
    about ‘Gentucca,’ uttered where he felt
    the wound of Justice which consumes them so.

    “O soul, that seemst so fain to speak to me,”
    said I, “so do that I may understand,
    and with thy words appease thyself and me.”

    “There is a woman born,” he then began,
    “nor weareth yet the veil, who, howsoe’er
    it be reproached, shall cause my town to please thee.
    With this prevision shalt thou now go on;
    and if by what I murmured thou wast led
    astray, events shall make it clear to thee.

    But tell me whether him I here behold,
    who those new rhymes produced, which thus begin:
    ‘Ye ladies, who well know what loving is.’”

    And him I answered: “I am one, who heed
    when Love within me breathes, and outwardly
    express myself as in me Love dictates.”

    “O brother, now I see” said he, “the bar,
    which kept this side the sweet new style I hear,
    the Notary, Guittone, and myself.
    I clearly see that your pens closely follow
    in the dictator’s wake, which certainly
    was not the case with ours; and he who further
    sets himself most to look, between these styles
    perceives no other difference.” Whereupon,
    as if content with this, he ceased to speak.

    As birds that spend the winter ’long the Nile,
    form in the air at times a flock, and then
    with greater speed fly on, and in a line
    advance; so likewise all the people there,
    quickened their steps with faces turned around,
    since through their leanness light, and through their will.

    And as a man who weary is of running,
    lets his companions go, and only walks,
    until the panting of his chest has ceased;
    ev’n so Forese let the holy flock
    pass on, and saying: “When shall I again
    behold thee?” came along behind with me.

    “I know not,” I replied, “how long I ’ll live;
    but I shall not so soon return, that sooner
    I shall not with my will be on the shore;
    because the place where I was set to live,
    strips itself further day by day of goodness,
    and now to dismal ruin seems ordained.”

    “Now go,” said he, “for him I see, who most
    hath blame for this, behind a beast’s tail dragged
    down to the Vale, where none e’er frees himself
    from fault. The beast with every step goes faster,
    and ever faster, till it hurls him down,
    and leaves his body in disgraceful plight.
    Those spheres have not much further to revolve,”
    (he raised his eyes toward heaven) “ere clear to thee
    will that become, which my words can explain
    no more. Stay now behind; for in this Realm
    so precious is our time, that, coming thus
    at even pace with thee, I lose too much.”

    As at a gallop from a riding troop
    a horseman issues forth at times, and goes
    to win the honor of the first encounter;
    so he with longer strides departed from us;
    and on the road with those two I remained,
    who of the world such mighty marshals were.

    When he had gone so far ahead, that now
    mine eyes became such followers of his form,
    as of his words my mind, the heavy laden

    and living branches of another Tree
    appeared before me not so far away,
    since toward it I had only then turned round.
    Beneath it folk I saw with upraised hands,
    who toward the foliage cried I know not what,
    like eager children who in vain beseech,
    while he, to whom they pray, replieth not,
    but with a view to make their longing keen,
    holds what they long for up, and hides it not.
    They then departed, as if undeceived;
    and thereupon to that great Tree we came,
    which turns away so many prayers and tears.

    “Pass on without approaching! Higher up
    a Tree there is, which bitten was by Eve,
    and this one is an offshoot sprung from that.”
    Thus said I know not who among the branches;
    hence Virgil, I, and Statius, close together,
    advanced along the side which rises up.
    “Recall” he said, “those cursèd cloud-born creatures,
    who, gorged with food and drink, ’gainst Theseus strove
    with double breasts; the Hebrews, too, recall,
    who at their drinking showed that they were soft,
    whence as his fellows Gideon had them not,
    when he on Midian down the hills advanced.”

    Thus, hugging close one margin of the ring,
    we passed, and heard of gluttonies,
    which once were followed by distressful gains.

    Then, spreading out across the lonely path,
    more than a thousand steps had borne us on,
    in contemplation each without a word.

    “What think ye three, as thus alone ye go?”
    a voice cried suddenly; whereat I started,
    as scared and sluggish beasts are wont to do.
    I raised my head to see who this might be;
    and ne’er were metals in a furnace seen,
    or glass, as red and bright, as one I saw
    who said: “If ye are pleased to mount above,
    ye must in this direction turn aside;
    this way goes he, who goes in quest of peace.”

    His aspect had bereft me of my sight;
    I therefore turned and stepped behind my Teachers
    like one who guides his feet by what he hears.

    And as, when heralding the light of dawn,
    the breeze of May sheds fragrance as it stirs,
    all redolent of grasses and of flowers;
    so, ’gainst my brow I felt a zephyr’s stroke,
    and well perceived the motion of the wing
    which made me scent ambrosian odors there.

    “Blessèd are they, whom so much Grace illumes,”
    I heard one saying, “that the love of taste
    stirs not too great a longing in their breast,
    but always hunger only as is right!”

Sensuality Punished. Instances of Chastity

    The hour was when ascent brooked no delay,
    because the sun had left the noon-time ring
    to Taurus, as to Scorpio had the Night;
    therefore, as doth a man who, whatsoe’er
    appear to him, stops not, but goes his way,
    if spurred by goading of necessity;
    so, one before the other, through the gap
    we entered in, and took the flight of stairs,
    which by its narrowness parts those who climb.

    And like the little stork, which lifts its wings,
    because it longs to fly, but ventures not
    to leave its nest, and lets them droop again;
    even such was I, with kindled, and with quenched
    desire to ask, when coming to the act
    of one who starts to speak. Nor, though our pace
    was fast, did my dear Father check himself,
    but said to me: “Discharge the bow of speech,
    which to the arrow-head thou now hast drawn.”

    With confidence I opened then my mouth,
    and said: “How can one possibly grow lean,
    where need of nourishment doth not obtain?”

    “Shouldst thou recall” he said, “how, when the brand
    was burning, Meleager was consumed,
    this would not be so difficult for thee;
    and shouldst thou think how, at your quivering,
    your image quivers in the looking-glass,
    that which seems hard to thee would easy seem.
    But that thou ease thee to thy heart’s content,
    lo, here is Statius; him I call and beg
    that he be now a healer of thy wounds.”

    “If I unfold for him the eternal view,
    when in thy presence,” Statius then replied,
    “be my excuse that I cannot refuse thee.”
    He then began: “If, son, thy mind shall hear
    and understand my words, they ’ll prove a light
    for thee unto the ‘how’ which thou dost ask.

    The perfect blood, which by the thirsty veins
    is never drunk, but stays as doth the food
    which from the table thou dost take away,
    gets in the heart a power informative
    for all the human members, being that
    which floweth through the veins to form the same.
    When redigested, it flows down to parts,
    whereof more seemly silence is than speech;
    then on another’s blood it trickles thence
    into the natural vessel. There both meet,
    passive the one, the other active, since
    perfect the place from which it was distilled;

    joining the former, it begins to work,
    coagulating first, then quickening that,
    which it had formed as matter for itself.
    The active virtue, now become a soul, —
    as of a plant, though so far differing from it,
    that this is on its way, and that, arrived, —
    so worketh next, that now it moves and feels,
    like fungi of the sea; then undertakes
    to organize the powers whose germ it is.
    That virtue, son, now spreads, and now extends,
    which from the generator’s heart derives,
    where Nature on all members is intent.
    But how from animal it comes to be
    a child, thou see’st not yet; a point so hard,
    it led a wiser man than thou so far
    astray, that, in his teaching, from the soul
    he parted the potential intellect,
    because he saw no organ it assumed.
    Open thy mind unto the coming truth,
    and know that, when the brain’s organization
    is in the foetus to perfection brought,
    the Primal Mover, glad of such a work
    of Nature, turns toward it, and breathes therein
    a spirit new and full of powers, which draws
    into its substance what it active finds
    therein, and so becomes a single soul,
    which lives and feels, and on itself reflects.

    And that the less thou wonder at my words,
    consider how to wine the sun’s heat turns,
    when joined to juices flowing from the vine!
    When Lachesis hath no more thread, the soul
    frees itself from the flesh, and bears away
    potentially the human and divine;
    mute one and all the other faculties,
    with memory, intelligence, and will
    far keener in their action than before.
    Then, without stopping, of itself it falls
    in wondrous way to one or other shore;
    here first it learns its road. As soon as place
    has circumscribed it there, the forming virtue
    rays round it in the same degree and way,
    as when the members were alive it did;
    and as the air, when fully charged with rain,
    is by another’s rays, which it reflects
    within itself, adorned with many hues;
    so here the neighboring air takes on the shape
    the soul, which settled there, impresses on it,
    as would a seal, by its own forming power;
    and afterward, as doth the little flame,
    which follows fire where’er it changes place,
    so the new shape accompanies its spirit;
    which, since it hence takes visibility,
    is called a shade; and therewith organizes
    each of the senses, up to that of sight.

    By means of this we speak, by means of this
    we laugh, and by this means we make the tears
    and sighs, thou mayst have heard upon the Mount.
    As our desires and other passions move us,
    our shade takes shape accordingly; and this
    the reason is of what thou wonderest at.”

    We now had reached the final circling place,
    and, to the right hand having turned our steps,
    intent we were upon another care.
    The bank here outwardly shoots forth a flame,
    while upward from the ledge below a blast
    is breathed, which drives it back, and keeps it off;
    hence one by one along the open side
    we had to walk; while I on one hand feared
    the fire, and, on the other, falling down.
    My Leader said to me: “Along this path
    a tight rein must be kept upon one’s eyes,
    for one might very easily go wrong.”

    “O God of highest Clemency,” I then
    heard sung within the bosom of the fire,
    whose glowing no less made me wish to turn;
    and spirits moving through the flame I saw;
    hence at their steps I looked, and at mine own,
    lending my eyes to each from time to time.

    After the lines with which that hymn concludes,
    aloud they shouted: “I know not a man;”
    then in low tones began the hymn again.

    They cried again, this ended: “To the woods
    Diana kept, and thence drove Hèlicë,
    for having known the taste of Venus’ poison.”
    Then they resumed the song; and then proclaimed
    the names of wives and husbands who were chaste,
    as virtue and the marriage state enjoin.

    And this course, I believe, suffices them
    for all the period, during which the fire
    is burning them; and such the care and diet,
    wherewith the wound is finally sewed up.

Instances of Natural and of Unnatural Lust

    While thus, one ’fore the other, ’long the edge
    we went, and my good Teacher often said:
    “Attention pay; and let my warning help thee!”
    the sun, which with its rays was changing now
    from azure all the western skies to white,
    was on my right side striking me; and I
    was with my shadow giving to the flame
    a brighter red; I noticed many shades
    give heed to this small sign, as on they moved.
    This was what started them to speak of me;
    and they began to say among themselves:
    “That one seems not to have an unreal body.”
    Then some of them, as far as possible
    drew near to me, though always with due care
    not to come out where they would not be burned.

    “O thou that goest on behind the rest,
    though not from sloth, but from respect, perhaps
    reply to me, who burn with thirst and fire!
    Nor is by me alone thine answer needed;
    for all these here have greater thirst therefor
    than Indians or Ethiopians for cold water.

    Inform us how it is that with thyself
    thou makest thus a wall against the sun,
    as if thou hadst not entered death’s snare yet.”

    Thus one of them addressed me; and at once
    had I declared myself, had I not heeded
    another novelty which then appeared;
    for through the middle of the flaming road
    folk with their faces turned the other way
    came on, and made me stop to gaze at them.
    There all the shades on every side I see
    make haste, and, without stopping, kiss each other,
    with this short form of greeting satisfied.

    Thus one ant from among its dark host touches
    its muzzle to another’s, to obtain,
    perhaps, directions as to path or fortune.

    As soon as they leave off their friendly greeting,
    and ere the first step has been taken there,
    each struggles to outcry the other shade;
    the new-come band shouts: “Sodom and Gomorrah!”
    the other: “In the cow Pasìphaë
    reclines, that to her lust the bull may run.”

    Thereat, like cranes, — if some of them should fly
    toward the Riphæan heights, and toward the sands
    the rest, these shunning ice, and those the sun, —
    one band departs, the other comes along;
    and weeping to their previous song they turn,
    and to the cry which best befitteth them.

    Then those same shades who had entreated me,
    drew near to me, as they had done before,
    with eagerness to listen in their looks.

    And I, who twice had seen what they desired,
    began: “O souls, who now are sure of having,
    whenever it may be, a state of peace,
    my body’s members have not stayed beyond,
    either unripe or ripe, but with their blood,
    and with their joints are really with me here.
    I hence go up, to be no longer blind.
    On high a Lady wins us Grace, whereby
    I carry through your world my mortal part.
    But, so may your best wish be soon fulfilled,
    in order that that heaven may shelter you,
    which, full of love, is amplest in its spread,
    tell me, that I may rule more paper for it,
    both who ye are, and what is yonder crowd,
    which onward goes its way behind your backs.”

    A mountaineer becomes not otherwise
    confused, nor, looking round, grows dumb,
    when, rough and wild, he enters first a town,
    than each shade did in its appearance there;
    but, when set free from that astonishment,
    which soon diminishes in high-born hearts,
    the one who questioned me before resumed:
    “Happy art thou, that shippest thus experience
    of these our bounds, that better thou mayst live!

    The people who come not along with us,
    in that offended, for which Caesar once
    when triumphing heard ‘Queen’ cried out against him;
    from us they therefore separate with cries
    of ‘Sodom,’ and by self-reproach assist,
    as thou hast heard, the burning by their shame.
    Our sin was intersexual; but, since we,
    by following our appetites like beasts,
    failed to conform ourselves to human law,
    to our confusion, when we leave the others,
    her name we cry, who bestialized herself
    by lying in the beast-resembling frame.
    Thou knowest now our deeds, and what our guilt;
    if who we are thou ’dst know, perhaps, by name,
    there is no time to tell, nor could I do it.
    As to myself, I ’ll rid thee of thy wish;
    I’m Guido Guinizelli, and purge me now,
    because of grieving well before the end.”

    As in Lycurgus’ anguish those two sons
    became, when they again beheld their mother,
    ev’n such did I, though I went not so far,
    when him I heard self-named, who father was
    to me and others, better men than I,
    who e’er made sweet and graceful rhymes of love;
    hence, lost in thought, nor hearing aught or speaking,
    I moved, and long I gazed at him in wonder,
    but, for the fire, no nearer drew to him.

    When I with looking had been fully fed,
    I put myself entirely at his service
    with those assurances which win belief.

    And he: “Thou leav’st in me a memory,
    from what I hear, so great and plain, that Lethe
    can neither wipe it out nor make it dim.
    But, if thy words swore what was true just now,
    tell me: why hast thou by thy speech and looks
    revealed to me that thou dost hold me dear?”

    And I to him: “’T was those sweet rhymes of yours
    which, while the modern form of speech endures,
    will e’er endear to me their very ink.”

    “Brother,” he said, “he whom I indicate,”
    (he pointed at a spirit on ahead)
    was of his mother tongue a better smith.
    In love-songs and in stories of romance
    he vanquished all; hence let those fools talk on,
    who think the Limousin excelleth him.
    To rumor, rather than to truth, they turn
    their faces, forming their opinions thus,
    ere art or reason have by them been heeded.
    Thus with Guittone many ancients did,
    giving, from cry to cry, to him alone
    the prize, until with most the truth prevailed.
    If now so amply privileged thou art,
    that lawful is thy going to the cloister,
    where Christ is Abbot of the brotherhood,

    a Pater-noster say to Him for me,
    or all of it that we in this world need,
    wherein no longer it is ours to sin.”

    And then, perhaps to yield his place to one
    near by him there, he vanished through the fire,
    as to the bottom would a fish through water.

    Toward him who had been pointed out I moved
    a little way, and said that my desire
    was for his name a gracious place preparing.

    “Your courteous question” he, unurged, began,
    “delighteth me so much, that I can not,
    nor do I wish to, hide myself from you.
    Arnaut am I, who, going, weep and sing;
    with sorrow my past folly I behold,
    and see with joy the hoped-for coming day.
    Now by the Power which guides you to the top
    of this short flight of stairs, I beg of you
    be mindful in due time of this my pain!”

    Then in the fire refining them he hid.

PURGATORIO XXVII

Purgatory. The Seventh Ring. Lust. The Angel of Purity

Dante’s Third Dream. Virgil’s Last Words

    As when he sends his earliest quivering beams
    where his Creator shed his blood, while Ebro
    ’neath lofty Libra falls, and Ganges’ waves
    are being scalded by the heat of noon,
    so stood the sun; daylight was, hence, departing,
    when God’s glad Messenger appeared to us.

    Outside the flames upon the bank he stood,
    and, in a voice far clearer than is ours
    was singing: “Blessèd are the pure in heart!”

    “No further may ye go, ye holy souls,
    until the fire have burned you; enter it,
    and be not deaf unto the song beyond!”
    he told us next, when we were near to him;
    hence I, on hearing him, became like one
    who in the grave is laid. Clasping my hands
    together, over them I bowed, and watched
    the fire, while vivid images I formed
    of human bodies I had once seen burned.

    Toward me my kindly Escorts turned around;
    and Virgil said to me: “There may, my son,
    be pain here, but not death. Recall to mind,

    recall to mind! . . . if even on Geryon’s back
    I safely led thee, what shall I do now,
    that nearer God I am? Assuredly believe
    that, if within the center of this flame
    thou shouldst for ev’n a thousand years remain,
    it could not make thee lose a single hair;
    and if, perchance, thou think that I deceive thee,
    draw near to it, and make thyself believe
    with thine own hands upon thy garment’s hem.
    Lay now aside, lay now aside all fear!
    Turn round toward me, and come ahead, assured!”
    And yet, though ’gainst my conscience, I moved not.

    On seeing me still motionless and firm,
    somewhat disturbed, he said: “Now see, my son;
    this wall remains ’tween Beatrice and thee.”

    As Pyramus, when dying, at the name
    of Thisbe, oped his eyes, and looked at her,
    what time the mulberry became vermilion;
    ev’n so, my stubbornness becoming weak,
    I turned to my wiser Leader, when I heard
    the name that ever wells up in my heart.

    Thereat he shook his head, and said: “What ’s this?
    Do we on this side wish to stay?” then smiled,
    as one does at a child an apple wins.
    Then, entering the fire in front of me,
    Statius he begged to come behind, who erst
    had over a long road divided us.

    When once inside, I would have thrown myself,
    that I might cool me, into boiling glass,
    so without measure was the burning there.
    My tender Father, to encourage me,
    talked, as we moved, of Beatrice alone,
    and said: “I seem to see her eyes already.”

    A voice that sang upon the further side,
    was guiding us; and we, on it alone
    intent, came forth to where the ascent began.

    “Ye blessèd of my Father, come!” was said
    within a light there, such that I thereby
    was overcome, and could not look at it.
    “The sun is setting, and the evening comes;”
    it added, “tarry not, but hasten on,
    while yet the western sky has not grown dark.”

    Straight upward went the pathway through the rock
    in such direction, that in front of me
    I cut the low sun’s rays; not many stairs
    had we yet tried, when I and my wise Leaders
    were, by my shadow’s vanishing, aware
    that back of us the sun had gone to rest.

    And ere in all of its unmeasured range
    the horizon had assumed one single tone,
    and night had everywhere diffused itself,
    each of a step had made himself a bed;
    because the nature of the Mount deprived us
    rather of power to climb than of desire.

    Like goats which, swift of foot and wanton once
    when on the mountain heights, ere being fed,
    grow tamely quiet when they ruminate,
    all silent in the shade, while yet the sun
    is hot, and guarded by a herd who leans
    upon his staff, and serves them as he leans;
    and like the shepherd in the open living,
    who calmly spends the night beside his flock,
    and keepeth watch lest some wild animal
    should scatter it; ev’n such all three of us
    were then, I like a goat, and they like shepherds,
    by the high rock hemmed in on either side.

    But little of the outer world could there
    be seen; but through that little I perceived
    the stars more bright and larger than their wont.

    While I was ruminating thus, and thus
    was gazing at them, sleep o’ertook me; sleep,
    which oft receiveth news of future things
    before they are. At that same hour, methinks,
    when Cytherèa, who, it seems, e’er burns
    with fires of love, beamed first upon the Mount
    from out the East, dreaming I seemed to see
    a Lady, young and fair, who, gathering flowers,
    was walking through a field, and as she sang,
    said: “Know, who asks my name, that I am Leah,
    and that I move my lovely hands about
    to make myself a wreath. To please myself

    when at my mirror, I adorn me here;
    but never doth my sister Rachel leave
    her looking-glass, but sits there all day long.
    Her pleasure is to see her lovely eyes,
    as mine is to adorn me with my hands;
    seeing contenteth her, and doing, me.”

    And now, before the splendid beams of dawn,
    which rise with greater thanks from travelers,
    as, coming home, they lodge less far away,
    the shades of night were fleeing everywhere,
    and with them sleep; hence I arose and saw
    that my great Teachers had already risen.

    “That pleasant fruit, which on so many boughs
    the care of men is ever looking for,
    shall give thine every hunger peace today.”

    These were the very words which Virgil used,
    when turned toward me; and never were there gifts,
    which in their sweetness could have equaled these.
    Such longing upon longing overcame me
    to be above, that at each step thereafter,
    I felt my pinions growing for the flight.

    When all the stairway had beneath us passed,
    and we were standing on its topmost step,
    on me then Virgil fixed his eyes, and said:
    “The temporal and the eternal fire, my son,
    thou now hast seen, and to a place art come,
    where I can, of myself, no further see.

    I ’ve brought thee here by genius and by art;
    henceforth as leader thine own pleasure take;
    forth art thou from both steep and narrow paths.
    Behold the sun there shining on thy brow;
    behold the tender grass, the flowers and shrubs,
    which here the soil yields of itself alone.
    Until in happiness those lovely eyes
    appear, which, weeping, made me come to thee,
    thou mayst be seated, or among them walk.
    From me expect no further word or sign.
    Free, right and sound is thine own will, and wrong
    were not to act according to its hest;
    hence o’er thyself I crown and mitre thee.”

PURGATORIO XXVIII

Terrestrial Paradise. The Divine Forest

Matelda. The River Lethe

    Keen now to look within and round about
    the wood divine, whose foliage dense and green
    was tempering for mine eyes the new day’s light,
    waiting no longer there, I left the edge,
    and entered very slowly on the plain,
    across a soil which everywhere breathed fragrance.

    A pleasant breeze, unvaried in itself,
    smote me upon the forehead with a stroke
    no greater than a gently blowing wind;
    whereby the branches trembling readily
    were all of them in that direction swaying,
    where first the holy Mount its shadow casts;
    yet ne’er deflecting from their upright state
    so much, that on their tops the little birds
    should give up practicing their every art;
    but singing with full gladness, they received
    the earliest breezes ’mong the leaves, which sang
    in undertone a burden to their songs,
    like that which gathers strength from bough to bough,
    throughout the grove of pines on Chiassi’s shore,
    when Aeolus has set Scirocco free.

    My slow steps now had carried me so far
    inside the ancient wood, that I no longer
    could see whence I had entered it; then, lo,
    a stream deprived me of advancing further,
    which with its little waves was toward the left
    bending the grass which sprang upon its bank.

    All waters which are purest here on earth
    would seem to have within themselves some mixture,
    if they should be compared to that one there,
    which hideth naught, though very darkly flowing
    ’neath the perpetual shade, which ne’er allows
    the rays of sun or moon to shine on it.

    I checked my feet, and with mine eyes passed on
    beyond the little stream, to gaze upon
    the great variety of flowering trees;
    and there, as when aught suddenly appears
    that turns through wonder every thought aside,
    a Lady all alone appeared to me,
    who singing went her way, and picking flowers,
    wherewith her path on every side was painted.

    “Prithee, fair Lady, thou that in love’s beams
    art warming thee, if outward looks I trust,
    which use to be a witness to the heart,
    let it thy pleasure be” said I to her,
    “to draw thee forward toward this stream so far,
    that I may understand what thou art singing.

    Thou makest me recall both where and what
    Prosèrpina was at the time, when her
    her mother lost, and she the flowers of spring.”

    As turns around a lady who, while dancing,
    her feet together keeps and on the ground,
    and hardly sets one foot before the other;
    so on the little red and yellow flowers
    turned she toward me, no otherwise than would
    a virgin lowering her modest eyes;
    and satisfied my prayers, for near to me
    she drew in such a way, that her sweet tones
    reached me with all of their significance.

    As soon as she was where the grass is bathed
    by that fair river’s wavelets, she conferred
    on me the gift of raising up her eyes.
    Nor do I think so bright a light shone forth
    from under Venus’ eyelids, when transfixed,
    wholly against his custom, by her son.
    As smiling on the other bank she stood,
    her hands kept picking other bright-hued flowers,
    which without seed the highland there brings forth.

    The river kept us still three steps apart;
    but ev’n the Hellespont, where Xerxes crossed it,
    a bridle still to every human pride,
    endured no greater hatred from Leander,
    because it surged ’tween Sestos and Abydos,
    than this from me because it then oped not.

    “New-comers are ye,” she began, “and hence
    because I smile in this place, which was chosen
    for human nature as its nest, some doubt,
    perhaps, still keeps you wondering here; and yet
    the psalm called ‘Delectasti’ gives you light,
    which from your minds can drive away your mist.
    And thou that art in front and didst entreat me,
    say whether thou wouldst hear aught else; for I
    came ready for thine every question’s need.”

    “The water and the music of the wood”
    said I, “impugn in me a recent faith
    in what I heard, which contradicted this.”

    Whence she: “I ’ll tell thee how from its own cause
    proceedeth that which makes thee wonder now,
    and clear the mist obstructing thee. The Good
    Supreme, which only by Itself is pleased,
    made man both good and apt to good, and gave him
    this place as earnest of eternal peace.
    Through his own fault he but a little while
    stayed here; through his own fault, for tears and toil
    exchanged he honest laughter and sweet play.
    In order that the trouble which, below,
    the earth’s and water’s exhalations cause
    by their own trend, which is to follow heat
    as best they may, should wage no war on man,
    this Mountain rose up toward the sky thus far;
    and free from them it is from where it ’s locked.

    And now, since all the atmosphere revolves
    and circles with the sphere of primal motion,
    unless its whirling round be somewhere broken,
    such motion strikes against this eminence,
    which in the living air is wholly free,
    and makes the forest, which is dense, resound;
    and so much power hath the stricken plant,
    that with its virtue it imbues the air,
    which by revolving scatters it about;
    the other land, as able of itself,
    or through its climate, next conceives and bears
    the divers qualities of divers trees.
    If this were heard, it would not seem to be
    a wonder yonder, when a plant takes root,
    without there being evidence of seed.
    And thou must know that all this holy plain
    where thou art now, is full of every seed,
    and fraught with fruit which yonder is not picked.
    The water thou beholdest wells not up
    from fountains fed by mists condensed by cold,
    as doth a stream which gains and loses breath;
    but issues from a sure and constant fount,
    which by the will of God regains as much
    as, open on both sides, it poureth forth.
    On this side with a virtue it descends,
    which takes from men all memory of sin;
    on the other it restoreth that of all

    good deeds. On this side it is Lethe called,
    on the other Eunoë, and worketh not,
    till tasted both on this side and on that.
    This greater is than are all other savors;
    and though thy thirst might be completely sated,
    should I reveal no more to thee, I ’ll give thee
    a corollary as a further grace;
    nor do I think my words will be less dear
    to thee, should they extend beyond my promise.

    Those who in ancient times sang of the Age
    of Gold, and of its happy state, perchance
    dreamed on Parnassus of this very place.
    Here was the root of mankind innocent;
    spring’s flowers and every fruit are always here;
    the nectar this, whereof all poets speak.”

    Thereat I turned around and, having faced
    my Poets, I perceived that they had heard
    this last interpretation with a smile;
    then toward the Lady beautiful I turned my face.

PURGATORY XXIX

Terrestrial Paradise. The River Lethe

The Mystic Pageant of the Church

    Singing as an enamoured lady would,
    when once her words were ended, she went on:
    “Blessèd are they whose sins are covered up!”
    And like the nymphs who used to go alone
    through woodland shades, desiring, one to see,
    the other to avoid, the sun; she then
    moved counter to the stream’s course, going up
    along its bank, and I at even pace,
    matching her little steps with steps as small.

    Her paces were with mine not yet a hundred,
    when both the margins equally were bent
    in such a way, that toward the East I faced.
    Nor had we yet as far again moved on,
    when round toward me the Lady wholly turned,
    and said: “My brother, look and listen now!”

    And lo, so bright a luster suddenly
    traversed the mighty wood in all directions,
    that I of lightning was compelled to think;
    but since this ceases as it comes, while that,
    the longer it endured, the brighter grew,
    within me I kept saying: “What is this?”

    And through the illumined air was running now
    a gentle melody; hence righteous zeal
    made me reproach the hardihood of Eve,
    who, while both earth and heaven obedient were,
    the only woman, and but just created,
    could not endure to stay beneath a veil;
    ’neath which if she had but devoutly kept,
    I should have tasted those unspeakable
    delights before, and for a longer time.

    While I mid such first fruits of bliss eternal
    was going all enrapt, and eager still
    for further joys,
    in front of us the air
    ’neath the green boughs became a blazing fire,
    and that sweet sound was now known as a song.

    O Virgins sacrosanct, if I have ever
    been hungry, cold or sleepless for your sake,
    good reasons spur my claiming a reward.
    For me now Helicon must pour her streams,
    and with her choir Urania give me help
    to set in verse things difficult to think.

    A little further on, the lengthy space
    still intervening ’tween ourselves and them,
    showed falsely what appeared seven trees of gold;
    but when I’d drawn so near to them, that now
    the common object which deceiveth sense,
    because of distance lost no attribute;

    the virtue which prepares discourse for reason
    perceived that they were candlesticks, and heard
    ‘Hosanna!’ in the voices of the song.
    Above, the fair array flamed far more brightly
    than in unclouded skies the midnight moon,
    when at the middle of her monthly course.

    Filled with astonishment, I turned around
    to my good Virgil, and he answered me
    with looks no less with wonder fraught. I then
    gazed back again at those exalted things,
    which toward us moved so slowly, that outrun
    they would have been by newly wedded brides.

    The Lady chided me: “Why dost thou gaze
    so ardently at those bright lights alone,
    and dost not look at that which follows them?

    I then saw people who were coming on,
    as if behind their leaders, clothed in white;
    and never was such whiteness here on earth.
    The water was resplendent on my left,
    and, like a mirror, if I looked in it,
    reflected back my body’s left to me.

    When I was on my bank so placed, that now
    only the river kept me at a distance,
    I checked my steps that I might better see,
    and I beheld the little flames advance,
    leaving the air behind them bright with color,
    and look like strokes a painter’s brush had drawn;

    so that, above, the air remained marked out
    by seven long bands, all in the hues wherewith
    the sun his bow, and Delia makes her belt.
    These standards further to the rear extended
    than I could see; as far as I could judge,
    the outermost ten paces were apart.

    There now were coming ’neath as fair a sky
    as I describe here, four and twenty Elders,
    two at a time, and crowned with fleur-de-lys.
    And all of them were saying: “Blest be thou
    ’mong Adam’s daughters, aye, and blessèd be
    throughout eternity thy beauty’s charms!”

    After the flowers and other tender blooms
    in front of me upon the other bank,
    had been set free from that elected folk,
    as in the sky star follows after star,
    so after these, four living Creatures came,
    each with a wreath of verdant foliage crowned.
    And each of them was feathered with six wings,
    their feathers full of eyes; and these were such,
    as, were they living, Argus’ eyes would be.

    I ’ll waste no more rhymes, Reader, to describe
    their forms; for other spending so constrains me,
    that I in this one cannot be profuse.
    But read thou in Ezechiel, who depicts them,
    as from the sky’s cold parts he saw them move,
    accompanied by wind, and clouds and fire;

    and such as in his pages thou wilt find them,
    such were they here, except that, as to wings,
    John is with me, and disagrees with him.

    The space extending ’tween the four contained
    a triumph-Chariot moving on two wheels,
    which came along drawn by a Griffon’s neck.
    Both of His wings the latter stretched on high
    ’tween the mid banner and the three and three,
    so that, by cleaving it, He injured none;
    so high they rose that they were lost to sight.
    His members were of gold as far as bird
    He was, and white the others mixed with red.
    Not only Rome ne’er with so fair a Car
    made Africanus or Augustus glad,
    but ev’n the Sun’s were poor, compared with this —
    the Sun’s, which, when it lost its way, was burned
    in answer to the suppliant Earth’s request,
    when Jupiter inscrutably was just.

    At its right wheel three Ladies in a ring
    came dancing on; the first so red, that hardly
    would she be noticed, if in fire she were;
    and such the second was, as if her flesh
    and very bones were made of emerald;
    the third one looked like newly fallen snow;
    and now led by the white one they appeared,
    now by the red; and from the latter’s song
    the others took their time, both slow and fast.

    Upon the left hand four, in purple clothed,
    were making glad, according to the gait
    of one of them with three eyes in her head.

    Behind the whole group I have here described,
    two old men I beheld, unlike in clothes,
    but like in mien, both dignified and grave;
    one showed himself a pupil of that great
    Hippocrates, whom for the animals
    she loves most dearly, Nature made; the other
    revealed the opposite intention with a sword
    so glittering and sharp, that though I stood
    on this side of the stream, it caused me fear.

    Then four I saw who were of humble mien;
    and, back of all, an agèd, keen-faced man
    advancing by himself and lost in sleep.

    These seven were robed in garments which resembled
    those of the primal company, though on their heads
    they wore not lily garlands, but were crowned
    with roses and with other crimson flowers;
    a distant sight of them had made one swear
    that all on fire they were above their brows.

    And when the Chariot was abreast of me,
    thunder was heard; whereat those worthy people
    appeared to have advance forbidden them,
    and stopped there with the standards in their van.

PURGATORIO XXX

Terrestrial Paradise. Lethe

Appearance of Beatrice. Disappearance of Virgil

    When the Septentrion of the highest heaven, —
    which never either setting knew, or rising,
    or veil of other mist than that of guilt,
    and which was causing every creature there
    to know his duty, as the lower one
    makes him who turns the helm to reach a port, —
    stopped suddenly; the people of the truth,
    who first had come between it and the Griffon,
    turned around toward the Car, as toward their peace;
    and one of them, as though from Heaven sent down,
    sang thrice aloud: “Come thou from Lebanon,
    my spouse!” and all the rest sang after him.

    As at the last trump-call each of the blest
    will quickly rise from out his tomb, and sing
    the Halleluiah with a voice regained;
    even so there rose upon the Car divine,
    at such an elder’s voice, a hundred servants
    and message-bearers of eternal life.
    They all were saying: “Blest be thou that comest!”
    and, strewing flowers on high and all around,
    “Oh, scatter forth your lilies with full hands!”

    I ’ve seen ere now when day began to dawn,
    the eastern skies all rosy, and the rest
    adorned with beauty and serenity;
    and then the sun rise with its face o’ershadowed
    in such a way that, through the tempering
    of mists, the human eye could long endure it;
    so likewise standing in a cloud of flowers,
    which rose from angel hands, and fell again
    within and out the Car, a Lady, crowned
    with a wreath of olives o’er a pure white veil,
    appeared before me, ’neath a cloak of green,
    clothed with the color of a living flame.

    My spirit hereupon, which for so long
    a time had not been trembling in her presence,
    or felt itself all broken down with awe,
    with no more knowledge of her by mine eyes,
    but through a hidden virtue issuing from her,
    felt the great power of the olden love.

    As soon as that high virtue smote my sight,
    which formerly had pierced me through and through,
    ere I had passed beyond my boyhood’s years,
    round to the left I turned me with the trust
    wherewith an infant to its mother runs,
    whenever terrified or in distress,
    to say to Virgil: “Less now than a drachm
    of blood remains in me that is not trembling;
    I feel the tokens of the olden flame.”

    But Virgil now had left us of himself
    deprived, Virgil, my dearest father, Virgil,
    to whom for my salvation I had giv’n me;
    nor yet did all our ancient mother lost
    avail to keep my cheeks, though cleansed with dew,
    from turning dark again because of tears.

    “Dante, though Virgil leave, weep thou not yet,
    weep thou not yet; for thou wilt need to weep
    by reason of another sword than this.”

    Even as an admiral, who, both on stern
    and prow, comes to behold the men that serve
    on the other ships, and urge them to do well;
    so likewise on the left side of the Car,
    when I had turned around me at the sound
    of mine own name, which here must needs be mentioned,
    I saw the Lady who had first appeared
    concealed beneath the Angels’ festival,
    direct her eyes toward me across the stream.

    Although the veil, which from her head hung down,
    encircled by Minerva’s olive leaves,
    did not allow her to appear distinctly;
    she went on royally, still stern in mien,
    as one doth who, when speaking, holdeth back
    his warmest words: “Look at us well, for we,
    indeed, are, we, indeed, are Beatrice!
    How wast thou able to approach the Mountain?
    Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”

    My lowered eyes fell on the limpid stream;
    but when I saw myself reflected there,
    I drew them to the grass, so great the shame
    that weighed my forehead down! As to her child
    a mother seems severe, so she to me,
    for bitter tastes the savor of harsh pity.

    Silent she kept, then suddenly the Angels
    chanted: “In Thee, Lord, have I set my trust,”
    but further than “my feet” they did not go.

    Even as the snow among the living beams
    grown on the back of Italy is frozen,
    when blown and hardened by Slavonian winds;
    and then, when melting, trickles through itself,
    if but the land that loses shadows breathe,
    and thus seems like a fire that melts a candle;
    ev’n so was I with neither tears nor sighs,
    before the song of those who ever tune
    their notes to music of eternal spheres.

    But when I heard in their sweet harmonies
    the sympathy they had for me, far more
    than had they said: “Why, Lady, shame him so?”
    the ice bound tightly round my heart was turned
    to breath and water, and through mouth and eyes
    issued with anguish from my inmost breast.

    Then she, still standing motionless
    upon the same side of the Car, addressed
    those sympathetic creatures with these words:

    “Ye keep your watches through the eternal day,
    so that nor night nor slumber robs from you
    one step the world may take upon its course;
    my answer, hence, is made with greater care,
    that he, who yonder weeps, may understand,
    and guilt and sorrow of one measure be.

    Not only through the work of those great spheres,
    which to some end directly guide each seed,
    according as the stars are its companions;
    but through the bounty of the Grace divine,
    which for its rain hath clouds so very high,
    our eyes cannot approach them; this one here
    was such potentially in early life,
    that all right dispositions would have had
    wondrous results in him. But all the more
    malign and savage doth a soil become,
    when sown with evil seed and left untilled,
    the better and more vigorous it is.
    I for a while sustained him with my face;
    and showing him my youthful eyes, I led him
    along with me turned in the right direction.
    But when the threshold of my second age
    I reached, and changed my life, he took himself
    away from me, and gave him to another.
    And when from flesh to spirit I had risen,
    and beauty and virtue had increased in me,
    less dear and pleasing was I then to him;

    and o’er an untrue path he turned his steps,
    following deceitful images of good,
    which naught that they have promised pay in full.
    Nor yet did it avail me to obtain
    the inspirations, wherewith both in dreams
    and otherwise I called him back; he cared
    so little for them! So low down he fell,
    that short were now all means for his salvation,
    save showing him the people that are lost.
    I visited the Gateway of the dead
    for this, and unto him who guided him
    up hither, fraught with tears, my prayers were borne.
    God’s high, fate-ordered Will would broken be,
    if Lethe should be passed, and should such food
    be tasted without paying first the scot
    of penitence made manifest by tears.”

PURGATORIO XXXI

Terrestrial Paradise. Dante’s Confession

His Immersion in Lethe. Beatrice Unveiled

    “O thou that art across the sacred stream,”
    toward me directing with its point her speech,
    which even edgewise had seemed sharp to me,
    continuing, she began without delay:
    “Say, say if this be true, to such a charge
    must thy confession be united now.”

    My strength was so confounded, that my voice
    began to move, and wholly died away,
    ere by its organs it had been released.

    A while she bore it; then: “What thinkest thou?”
    she said, “Reply; for thy sad memories
    are not extinguished by the water yet.”

    Perplexity and fear together mixed
    extorted such a ‘Yes’ from out my mouth,
    that eyes to hear its utterance were required.

    Even as a crossbow breaks its cord and bow,
    whenever with too great a tension shot,
    and with less force the arrow strikes its mark;
    so ’neath that heavy burden I broke down,
    and as I poured forth gushing tears and sighs,
    my voice more slowly through its passage came.

    Then she: “Across the paths which I desired,
    and which were leading thee to love the Good,
    beyond which there is nothing one can wish,
    what trenches didst thou find, or hindering chains,
    for which thou thus must needs despoil thyself
    of hope of further progress on thy way?
    What luring charms or what advantages
    displayed themselves upon the brows of others,
    that thou shouldst pay thy passing court to them?”

    Thereat, when I had heaved a bitter sigh,
    I scarcely had the voice to make an answer,
    and painfully my lips gave form to it.
    Weeping, I said: “Things of the present turned
    with their delusive joy my steps aside,
    as soon as e’er your face was hid from me.”

    “Hadst thou been silent, or hadst thou denied”
    said she, “what thou confessest, no less clear
    would be thy guilt, since known by such a Judge.
    But when self-accusation of one’s sin
    from one’s own cheek breaks forth, in this our court
    the wheel is turned to blunt the sharpened edge.
    And yet, that for thy fault thou mayst be now
    the more ashamed, and that, when thou again
    shalt hear the sirens, thou mayst stronger be,
    desist thou now from sowing tears, and hark;
    so shalt thou hear o’er what a different path
    my buried body should have moved thy feet.

    Nature ne’er showed thee, nor did art, such beauty
    as did the pleasing members which enclosed me,
    and which are scattered now, dissolved in earth;
    hence if the highest pleasure failed thee thus
    by reason of my death, what mortal thing
    should afterward have drawn thee to desire it?
    At the first arrow of deceitful things
    thou surely oughtest to have risen up
    to follow me, who was no longer such.
    Thy wings, at least, should not have been weighed down,
    to wait for further blows from some young girl,
    or other vain thing of as brief a use.
    A young bird waits for two blows or for three;
    but ’fore the eyes of fully feathered birds
    a net is spread or arrow shot in vain.”

    As children who are silent when ashamed,
    and with their eyes upon the ground, keep list’ning,
    and conscience-stricken and repentant are;
    so I remained; and she: “Since thou art grieved
    because of hearing me, lift up thy beard,
    and thou from seeing shalt receive more grief.”

    With less resistance is a sturdy oak
    uprooted, either by our native wind,
    or by the wind that blows from Jarba’s land,
    than I at her behest raised up my chin;
    and when by ‘beard’ she asked to see my face,
    I well perceived the venom in her words.

    Thereafter when my face was raised again,
    I saw that those first creatures were at rest
    from strewing flowers; and thereupon mine eyes,
    which were as yet but partially assured,
    saw Beatrice turned toward the Animal
    which in two natures one sole person is.
    Though ’neath her veil and ’cross the stream, it seemed
    to me that she surpassed her old-time self,
    more than she did all others, when on earth.

    So pricked me now the nettle of repentance,
    that, of all other things, what turned me most
    unto its love, became to me most hostile.
    Whereat such great contrition gnawed my heart,
    that, overcome, I fell; and what I then
    became, she knows who gave me cause for it.

    Then, when my heart restored my outward strength,
    I saw the Lady I found alone, above me,
    saying: “Hold on to me! Hold on to me!”

    Into the stream she had already borne me
    up to my neck, and, dragging me behind her,
    light as a shuttle o’er its top was moving.
    When I was near the blessèd shore, I heard:
    ‘Purge me with hyssop’ said in tones so sweet,
    that far from writing, I can not recall it.

    The lovely Lady, stretching out her arms,
    embraced my head, and plunged me in the stream
    so far, that I was forced to drink its water.

    Drawing me thence, she set me when thus bathed
    within the dance-ring of the lovely four;
    and each of them embraced me with her arm.

    “Nymphs are we here, and in the sky are stars;
    ere Beatrice came down into the world
    we were ordained to be her maids. We ’ll lead thee
    to see her eyes; but, for the joyous light
    therein, the three upon the other side,
    who more profoundly gaze, will sharpen thine.”

    Thus singing they began; and thereupon
    they led me with them to the Griffon’s breast,
    where, turning toward us, Beatrice remained.
    And “See to it that thou spare not thine eyes;”
    they said, “before the emeralds we have set thee,
    whence Love of old against thee drew his shafts.”

    A thousand wishes hotter far than flames
    bound mine eyes fast to those resplendent eyes,
    which on the Griffon set their steady gaze.
    As in a glass the sun, not otherwise
    the two-fold Animal was gleaming in them,
    at first in one, then in another way.

    Think, Reader, if I wondered, when I saw
    that It was keeping quiet in Itself,
    while in Its image It was changing form.

    While, glad and with amazement filled, my soul
    was tasting of the food, which, while it sates,
    still causes thirst and hunger for itself;

    proving themselves to be of higher rank
    by reason of their deeds, the other three
    came dancing to their angel roundelay.

    “Turn thou,” their song was, “turn thou, Beatrice,
    thy holy eyes upon thy faithful one,
    who hath, to see thee, ta’en so many steps.
    Kindly do us the favor to unveil
    thy mouth to him, that he may thus perceive
    the second loveliness which thou dost hide.”

    O Splendor of eternal living Light,
    who, ’neath Parnassus’ shades, e’er grew so pale,
    or from its cistern e’er so deeply drank,
    as not to feel bewildered in his mind,
    should he attempt to paint what thou didst seem,
    when, symbolized by Heaven’s own harmonies,
    thou didst reveal thee in the open air?

PURGATORIO XXXII

Terrestrial Paradise. Vicissitudes and

Transformation of the Car. The Harlot and the Giant

    So steadfast were mine eyes and so intent
    on gratifying their decennial thirst,
    that all my other senses were asleep;
    and both on this side and on that a wall
    of heedlessness they had, the holy smile
    so strongly drew them with the olden net;
    when forcibly my face was toward my left
    turned by those Goddesses, for from their lips
    I now was hearing a “Too steadfastly!”
    Thereat the state of vision which exists
    in eyes but newly smitten by the sun,
    caused me to be awhile deprived of sight.

    But when my eyes were to the small accustomed,
    (I say ‘the small’ with reference to the great
    resplendence, whence perforce I turned away,)
    I saw that on the right the glorious host
    had wheeled, and was returning with the sun
    and with the sevenfold flame in front of it.

    As, to protect itself, a troop revolves
    beneath its shields, and wheeleth with its flag,
    before the whole of it can change direction;

    even so the heavenly Kingdom’s soldiery
    who forward were, had wholly passed us by,
    before its pole had made the Chariot turn.
    Back to the wheel the Ladies then returned;
    and so the Griffon drew His blessèd burden,
    that, though He moved, no feather of him shook.

    The Lady fair, who through the ford had drawn me,
    Statius and I, were following the wheel
    which made its orbit with the smaller arc.
    As thus we crossed the lofty wood, unpeopled
    because of her who trusted to the Serpent,
    a song angelic kept our steps in time.

    A liberated arrow in three flights,
    perhaps, as great a distance would have gone,
    as we had moved, when Beatrice alighted.
    “Adam!” I then heard murmured by them all;
    they circled then around a Tree, despoiled
    of flowers and other leaves on every branch.
    Its crowning boughs, spread out in greater width,
    the higher up they are, would for their height
    be wondered at by Indians in their woods.

    “Thou, Griffon, happy art, since with Thy beak
    Thou tearest not this pleasant tasting wood,
    because one’s belly writhes in pain therewith.”
    Thus round the sturdy Tree the others cried;
    whereat the Double-natured Animal:
    “Thus is the seed of all just deeds preserved.”

    Then, turning toward the pole which He had drawn,
    He dragged it forward to the widowed Tree,
    and ’neath it left that part of it tied up.

    As our plants swell, when falls the great light, mixed
    with that which shines behind the heavenly Carp,
    and as each thereupon renews itself
    in its own color, ere the sun yokes up
    his racing horses ’neath another star;
    even so, a hue revealing, not as bright
    as that which roses have, and more than that
    of violets, that Tree renewed itself,
    whose branches once had been so bare of leaves.

    I understood not (’t is not sung on earth,)
    the hymn which thereupon that people sang,
    nor did I bear to hear the whole song through.

    If I could picture how the unpitying eyes,
    on hearing Syrinx’ story, sleepy grew,
    the eyes to which much waking cost so dear;
    as doth an artist who from models paints,
    would I describe how I then fell asleep;
    but let whoever will, feign sleeping well.
    Hence to the point I pass, when I awoke;
    and say a splendor rent my slumber’s veil,
    and then a call: “Arise! What doest thou?”

    As Peter, John and James were led to see
    some of the early blossoms of the apple,
    which makes the Angels eager for its fruit,

    and causes endless marriage-feasts in Heaven;
    and, overcome, recovered at the word
    whereby far greater slumbers had been broken;
    and even as they perceived their company
    diminished both by Moses and Elias,
    and all the raiment of their Master changed;
    so I, recovering, near me standing saw
    that pitying Lady who before had been
    the leader of my steps along the stream.

    “But where is Beatrice?” all lost in doubt
    I said. Whence she: “Behold her sitting there,
    beneath the Tree’s new leaves, upon its roots.
    Behold the company surrounding her;
    the rest on high behind the Griffon go,
    with songs of sweeter sound and deeper theme.”

    I know not if at greater length her words
    were poured, because now in mine eyes was she,
    who hindered my attending to aught else.
    On the bare ground she sat, and all alone,
    left there to be the guardian of the Car
    I saw the Biformed Animal tie up.
    Circling, the seven Nymphs with their persons formed
    a hedge for her, those lights held in their hands,
    which safe from Auster are and Aquilo.

    “Here for a while shalt thou a woodman be;
    then without end with me a citizen
    of that Rome, whereof Christ a Roman is.

    Hence, for the world’s sake, which lives badly, keep
    thine eyes upon the Car, and what thou see’st
    be sure to write, when once on earth again.”

    Thus Beatrice; and I, who now was wholly
    devoted at the feet of her commands,
    whither she wished turned both my mind and eyes.

    Fire ne’er descended with so swift a motion
    out of dense clouds, when from the highest region
    the rain is falling, as I now beheld
    the bird of Jove swoop down upon the Tree,
    and break not only its new budding leaves
    and blossoms, but its bark; with all his might
    he smote the Chariot next; whereat it reeled,
    as in a storm a ship, when by the waves
    to starboard now, and now to larboard driven.

    And then a she-Fox which from all good food
    seemed fasting, I perceived, hurling herself
    against the bottom of the triumph-Car;
    but, for her ugly sins upbraiding her,
    my Lady put her to such speedy flight
    as was permitted by her fleshless bones.

    Thereafter, whence it first had come, I saw
    the Eagle down into the Chariot’s ark
    descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes;
    and such a voice as from a suffering heart
    comes forth, was that which came from Heaven, and said:
    “My little Ship, how badly thou art laden!”

    Between both wheels the earth seemed opened then,
    and forth from it I saw a Dragon come,
    who upward through the Chariot thrust his tail;
    and like a wasp which draweth back its sting,
    withdrawing his bad tail, he drew away
    part of its floor, and, keen for more, went off.
    That which remained reclothed itself again,
    as rich soil doth with grasses, with the plumes,
    offered, perhaps, with wise and kind intent;
    then one wheel and the other and the pole
    were covered up so quickly, that a mouth
    is open kept much longer by a sigh.

    When thus the holy Structure was transformed,
    it put forth heads upon its members, three
    upon its pole, and at each corner one.
    The first were horned like oxen, but the four
    had on their foreheads but a single horn;
    never had such a monster yet been seen.

    Sitting thereon, as boldly as a fort
    is seated on a lofty mountain-top,
    a shameless Prostitute appeared before me,
    with eyebrows that were quick to wander round;
    and then, to see that none should take her from him,
    I saw a Giant standing at her side;
    at times they kissed each other there; but since
    she turned her greedy, fickle eyes on me,
    that cruel lover scourged her from her head

    unto her soles. Then, filled with jealousy,
    and cruel in his wrath, loosing the Monster,
    he dragged it through the wood so far away,
    that with this last alone he shielded me
    against the Harlot and unnatural Beast.

PURGATORIO XXXIII

Terrestrial Paradise. Beatrice’s Prophecy

Dante’s Final Purification in the River Eunoë

    “O God, the heathen folk are come,” now three,
    now four, alternately, and shedding tears,
    the Ladies a sweet psalmody began;
    and Beatrice with sighs of sympathy
    was listening to their words with such a look,
    that Mary at the cross changed little more.

    But when the other maids had given way
    that she might speak, she rose upon her feet,
    and, colored with the hue of fire, replied;
    “A little while, and ye shall not behold me;
    and then again, belovèd sisters mine,
    a little while, and me ye shall behold.”

    All seven she thereupon before her placed,
    and, merely by a nod, behind her moved
    me and the Lady, and the Sage who stayed.

    She thus was going on, nor do I think
    her tenth step had been set upon the ground,
    when with her eyes she forcibly met mine;
    then with a tranquil face she said to me:
    “More quickly come, that, if I speak to thee,
    for listening to me thou mayst be well placed.”

    As soon as I was with her as I ought,
    she said to me: “Why, brother, dost not venture
    to question me, now that thou comest with me?”

    As unto those who show excessive reverence,
    when speaking in the presence of their elders,
    and therefore draw no clear voice to their teeth,
    to me it happed that with imperfect tones
    “Madonna,” I began, “my welfare’s needs
    you know, and that which may be good for it.”

    And she to me: “From fear and bashfulness
    I wish thee now to extricate thyself,
    that thou mayst speak no more like one who dreams.
    Know that the Vessel which the Serpent broke,
    was, and is not; but let whose fault it is,
    believe God’s vengeance fears not human sops.
    Nor shall the Eagle heirless for all time
    remain, who left his feathers on the Car,
    whence monstrous it became, and then a prey;
    for I see well, and therefore tell it, stars
    now near, and from all checks and obstacles
    secure, which for us shall a time obtain,
    within which a Five Hundred Ten and Five,
    sent forth by God, shall kill the female Thief,
    and that great Giant who with her is guilty.
    And my prediction, which is dark, perhaps,
    as Themis and the Sphinx, persuades thee less,
    because, as theirs did, it beclouds thy mind;

    but facts will soon become the Naiades,
    which shall this difficult enigma solve,
    without the loss of either sheep or grain.
    Give heed; and ev’n as uttered by myself,
    see that thou teach these words of mine to those
    that live the life which is a race toward death;
    and bear in mind, when thou art writing them,
    not to conceal in what state thou hast seen
    the Tree, which twice now hath been here despoiled.
    Whoever robs or teareth that apart,
    with blasphemy of deed offendeth God,
    who for His own use only made it holy.
    For biting it, in pain and in desire
    the first soul longed for Him five thousand years
    and more, who punished in Himself the bite.
    Thy mind is sleeping, if it deemeth not
    that for a special cause it soars so high,
    and at its summit so inverted is.
    And if the vain thoughts which surround thy mind
    had not been Elsa water, and their pleasure
    as to the mulberry a Pyramus,
    thou, by so many circumstances only,
    wouldst in the interdict upon the Tree
    see morally God’s Justice. But, since made
    of stone I see thee in thine understanding,
    and, being petrified, so dark in mind
    that thou art blinded by my speech’s light,

    I also, if not written, wish that painted,
    at least, thou bear it in thee, for the reason
    the pilgrim’s staff is carried wreathed with palm.”

    And I: “As sealing-wax, which changes not
    the shape imprinted on it by the seal,
    so likewise is my brain now stamped by you.
    But why so far above my mental sight
    are your desired words now flying up,
    it loses them the more, the more it strives?”

    “That thou,” she said, “mayst thus appraise the school
    which thou hast followed, and perceive how able
    its teaching is to carry out my word;
    and also see that your ways are removed
    as far from the divine, as e’er the heaven
    which speeds most high is distant from the earth.”

    Whence her I answered: “I do not recall
    that I have e’er estranged myself from you,
    nor am I conscious of remorse therefor.”

    “And if thou canst not call it to thy mind,”
    she answered with a smile, “remember now
    that this same day thou hast of Lethe drunk;
    and if from smoke a fire may be inferred,
    this thy forgetfulness but clearly proves
    a fault in thy desire intent elsewhere.
    Truly my words shall naked be henceforth,
    as much at least as it shall needful seem
    to make them clear to thine untutored sight.”

    Both more refulgent and with slower steps
    the sun was holding now the noonday circle,
    which, with each point of view, moves here and there;
    when, even as he, who as a leader goes
    ahead of people, stops, if something new
    he find upon his path, the Ladies seven
    stopped at a death-pale shadow’s edge,
    like that which ’neath green leaves and darkling boughs
    the Alps cast o’er their icy mountain-streams.
    In front of them I seemed to see Euphrates
    and Tigris from one fountain issue forth,
    and from each other slowly part as friends.

    “O Light and Glory of the human race,
    what stream is this which from one source unfolds,
    and then from its own self itself withdraws?”

    In answer to this question I was told:
    “Pray that Matelda tell thee.” Whereupon,
    like one who frees himself from blame, replied
    the lovely Lady: “This, with other things,
    hath he been told by me; and I am sure
    that Lethe’s water hath not hid it from him.”

    And Beatrice: “Perhaps a greater care
    which oft deprives one’s memory of its power,
    hath made the vision of his mind’s eye dark.
    But Eunoë behold, which yonder now
    is flowing forth; conduct him to its bank,
    and, as thou ’rt wont, revive his lifeless power.”

    Even as a noble soul makes no excuse,
    but to another’s will its own conforms,
    as soon as e’er by outward signs disclosed;
    even so, when she had taken hold of me,
    the lovely Lady moved, and then to Statius
    said with a lady’s manner: “Come with him.”

    If, Reader, I had now more space for writing,
    I’d sing, at least in part, of that sweet drink,
    which never would have satisfied my thirst;
    but inasmuch as filled are all the pages
    planned warp-like for this second Canticle,
    no further doth art’s bridle let me go.

    From that most holy water I returned
    made young again, as new trees are in spring,
    when with new foliage they renew themselves,
    pure, and disposed to rise up to the stars.


PARADISO I

Introduction to the Paradiso. Invocation of Apollo. Ascent through the Sphere of Fire. The Order of the Universe

    The Glory of Him who moveth everything,
    penetrates all the Universe, and shines
    more brightly in one part, and elsewhere less.

    Within the Heaven which most receives His Light
    I was; and saw what he who thence descends
    neither knows how, nor hath the power, to tell;
    for as it draweth near to its Desire,
    our intellect so deeply sinks therein,
    that recollection cannot follow it.
    As much, however, of the holy Realm
    as in my memory I could treasure up,
    shall now become the subject of my song.

    O Good Apollo, for my final task
    make me as worthy a vessel of Thy Power,
    as Thou dost ask for Thy dear laurel’s gift.
    One of Parnassus’ peaks hath hitherto
    sufficed me; but with both of them I now
    must start upon the course which still remains.
    Enter my breast, and breathe Thou as of old
    Thou didst, when from the scabbard of his limbs
    Thou drewest Marsyas forth.

    O Power Divine,
    if Thou but lend Thyself to me so much,
    that I may show the blessèd Kingdom’s shadow
    which in my mind is stamped; to Thy dear tree
    Thou ’lt see me come, and crown me with the leaves
    my theme and Thou shall cause me to deserve.
    So seldom, Father, are there any picked,
    to grace a Caesar’s or a Poet’s triumph,
    (the fault of human wills, and to their shame),
    that His Peneian leaf should bring forth joy
    within the Joyous Delphic Deity,
    when for itself it causes one to thirst.

    A great flame follows from a little spark;
    perhaps with better voices after me
    shall men so pray, that Cyrrha will reply.

    For mortal men the lantern of the world
    rises through divers passes; but from that
    which with three crosses brings four rings together,
    it issues on a more propitious course,
    and in conjunction with a kinder star,
    and more in its own image moulds and seals
    the mundane wax. A pass almost like this
    had made it morning there and evening here;
    and all that hemisphere was white, and black
    the other side; when Beatrice I saw
    turned toward her left, and looking at the sun;
    no eagle ever gazed at it so keenly.

    And even as from the first a second ray
    is wont to come, and upward start again,
    as would a pilgrim longing to return;
    even so to her act, by mine eyes infused
    through my imagination, mine conformed;
    and on the sun I gazed beyond our wont.

    Much is permitted there, which is not here
    allowed our faculties, thanks to the site
    created as the human race’s home.

    Not long did I endure it, nor so briefly,
    as not to see it sparkle all around,
    as molten iron doth, when out of fire
    it issues boiling; day then all at once
    seemed joined to day, as if the One who can
    had with another sun adorned the sky.

    With eyes fixed wholly on the eternal wheels
    stood Beatrice; and I on her fixed mine,
    from there above removed. Looking at her,
    I such became within, as Glaucus did
    on tasting of the herb, which in the sea
    made him a fellow of the other Gods.

    Transhumanizing could not be expressed
    by words; let this case, therefore, him suffice,
    for whom Grace holds experience in reserve.

    If I, O Love that rulest Heaven, was only
    that part of me, which Thou didst last create,
    Thou know’st, that with Thy Light didst raise me up.

    When the rotation Thou, by being longed for,
    dost make eternal, drew me to itself
    by harmonies distributed and tuned
    by Thee, it seemed that so much of the sky
    was by the sun’s flame set on fire, that rain
    nor river ever made so broad a lake.

    The newness of the sound, and brilliant light
    kindled in me a wish to know their cause,
    never with so great keenness felt; whence she,
    who saw me ev’n as I behold myself,
    opened her mouth to calm my troubled mind,
    ere I did mine to question, and began:

    “With false imagining dost thou so dull
    thyself, that thou perceivest not what else
    thou wouldst perceive, if thou hadst thrown it off.
    Thou ’rt not on earth, as thou dost think thyself;
    but lightning fleeing from its proper place
    ne’er ran as thou, that art thereto returning.”

    If I was by her little smiled-out words
    of my first doubt relieved, within a new one
    was I the more ensnared; I therefore said:
    “Already sated, I had found repose
    from great amazement; but I wonder now
    how I can these light elements transcend.”

    Heaving, thereat, a pitying sigh, she turned
    her eyes upon me with the look a mother
    gives her delirious child; and then began:

    “All things, whate’er they be, an order have
    among themselves; and form this order is,
    which makes the Universe resemble God.
    Therein exalted creatures see the trace
    of that Eternal Worth, which is the end
    for which the mentioned order is created.
    Within the ordered state whereof I speak,
    all natures have their place with different lots,
    as nearer to their source they are, or less;
    wherefore toward different ports they wend their way
    through the vast sea of being, each endowed
    with instinct, granted it to bear it on.
    This instinct toward the moon impelleth fire;
    this is the motive force in mortal hearts;
    this binds together and unites the earth;
    nor doth this bow impel those creatures only
    which lack intelligence, but those that have
    intelligence and love. The Providence
    which ordereth all this, with Its own Light
    e’er calms the heaven, inside of which revolves
    the one that moveth with the greatest speed.
    And thither now, as to a place ordained,
    that bowstring’s power is bearing us along,
    which to a glad mark speeds whate’er it shoots.
    ’T is true that, as a form is frequently
    discordant with the intention of an art,
    because its matter in response is deaf;

    so likewise from this natural course at times
    a creature turns away; for power it hath,
    though thus impelled, to bend aside elsewhere,
    (as one may see fire falling from a cloud),
    if, by false pleasure drawn, that primal impulse
    turn it aside to earth. If well I judge,
    no further shouldst thou wonder at thy rising,
    than at a stream thou dost, which to its foot
    down from a lofty mountain’s top descends.
    As great a marvel would it be in thee,
    if, rid of hindrance, thou hadst sat thee down,
    as rest, on earth, would in a living flame.”

    Then toward the sky she turned her face again.

PARADISO II

The First Heaven. The Moon. Reflected Happiness

Inconstant Spirits who failed to keep their Vows

    O ye who, in a little boat embarked,
    have, fain to listen, followed in the wake
    of this my ship, which, singing, ploughs ahead,
    go back to see your shores again! Start not
    upon the ocean; for, if me ye lost,
    ye might, perhaps, be left behind astray.

    The seas I sail were never crossed before;
    Minerva breathes, Apollo is my guide,
    and all nine Muses point me out the Bears.

    Ye other few, who early raised your necks
    for Angels’ bread, on which one here on earth
    subsists, but with which none are ever sated,
    ye well may start your vessel on the deep
    salt sea, if in the furrow of my ship
    ye stay, ere smooth again the waves become.
    Those glorious ones, who crossed the seas to Colchis,
    were not so much amazed, as ye shall be,
    when Jason turned a ploughman they beheld.

    The innàte and ceaseless thirsting for the Realm
    in God’s own image made, was bearing us
    as swiftly as ye see the heavens revolve.

    On high looked Beatrice, and I on her;
    and in the time, perhaps, an arrow takes
    to light, and fly, and from the notch be freed,
    I saw that I had come to where a marvel
    turned to itself my sight; hence she, from whom
    the working of my mind could not be hid,
    as glad as she was lovely, turned toward me,
    and said: “Direct thy grateful mind to God,
    who with the first star hath united us.”

    Meseemed as if a cloud were covering us,
    as luminous and dense, as hard and polished,
    as is a diamond smitten by the sun.
    Within itself the eternal pearl received us,
    as water, though unbroken it remain,
    receives within itself a ray of light.

    If body I was (nor can one here conceive
    how one dimension could endure another,
    which needs must be, if body enter body),
    the more should we be kindled by the wish
    that Essence to behold, wherein is seen
    how once with God our nature was conjoined.
    Thère will be seen, what here we hold by faith,
    not demonstrated, but will self-known be,
    as is the primal truth which men believe.

    “My Lady,” I replied, “as best I can
    do I devoutly render thanks to Him,
    who from the mortal world hath severed me.

    But tell me what this body’s dark spots are,
    which cause the folk down yonder on the earth
    to tell each other fables about Cain.”

    She smiled a little, then she said: “If mortals’
    opinion therein errs, where key of sense
    unlocketh not, surely the shafts of wonder
    ought not to pierce thee now;
    for thou perceivest
    that short are Reason’s wings, when following sense.
    But tell me what thou think’st thereof thyself.”

    And I: “What seems to us diverse up here,
    is caused, I think, by bodies thin and dense.”

    And she: “Thou ’lt surely see that thy belief
    is sunk in error, if but well thou heed
    the arguments I ’ll now oppose to it.

    The eighth sphere shows you many shining stars,
    which both in quality and magnitude,
    may be observed to differ in their looks.
    If only rarity and density
    caused this, among them all one single virtue
    would more, and less, and equally be shared.
    Virtues that differ needs must be the fruit
    of formal principles, and these, save one,
    would, by thy way of reasoning, be destroyed.
    Again, if thinness caused the dusky spots
    which thou dost ask about, this planet would,
    in portions, through its bulk its matter lack,

    or, as a body what is fat and lean
    distributes, so would this one alternate
    its volume’s leaves. If true the former were,
    ’t would in the sun’s eclipses be revealed,
    because the latter’s light would then shine through,
    as when in other thin things introduced.
    This does not happen; hence the other one
    must be considered now; and should I chance
    to quash it, false will thy opinion prove.

    If, therefore, it be so that this thin part
    extends not through, a limit there must be,
    beyond which what is contrary thereto
    allows it not to pass; the other’s ray
    is, hence, reflected, as color from a glass
    returns, which back of it concealeth lead.
    Thou ’lt now say that the ray seems dimmer there
    than in the other parts it is, because
    from further back reflected. From this retort
    experimenting, which is wont to be
    the fountain of the rivers of your arts,
    can, if thou ever try it, set thee free.
    Thou ’lt take three mirrors; two of them removed
    at equal distance from thee, let the third,
    placed ’tween them, more remotely meet thine eyes.
    Then, turning toward them, let a lamp stand so
    between them, as to shine upon all three,
    and be reflected on thee from them all.

    Though the most distant light will not extend
    so much in quantity, thou ’lt see thereby
    how it must needs with equal brightness shine.
    And now, as at the stroke of burning rays,
    what lies beneath the snow is wholly bared
    of what were previously its cold and color;
    thee, thus remaining in thine intellect,
    will I inform with such a living light,
    that it will quiver when thou seest it.

    Within the heaven of Peace Divine revolves
    a body, subject to whose influence lies
    the being of whatever it contains.
    The next, which hath so many eyes, distributes
    that being ’mong the different essences,
    distinguished from it, and contained by it.
    The other spheres, by various differences,
    dispose to their effects and causes those
    distinctions which within themselves they have.
    These organs of the world so go their way,
    as thou perceivest now, from grade to grade,
    that from above they take, and downward act.
    Give me good heed, as through this argument
    I seek the truth thou wishest, that henceforth
    thou mayst know how to cross the ford alone.
    The holy circles’ influence and motion,
    as from the blacksmith doth the hammer’s art,
    must from the blessèd Motors be inspired;

    and that heaven which so many lights adorn,
    receives its impress from the Mind profound,
    which turneth it, and makes thereof a seal.
    And as the soul which lives within your dust
    unfolds itself through members, which are different,
    and unto different potencies conformed;
    so likewise, multiplied among the stars,
    doth that Intelligence unfold its goodness,
    while on its unity itself revolves.
    Each different power a different alloy makes,
    mixed with the precious body which it quickens,
    and with which it unites, as life in you.
    Because of that glad nature whence it flows,
    the mingled virtue through the body shines,
    as, through a living pupil, joy. From this
    comes what ’tween light and light a difference seems,
    and not from rarity and density;
    this is the formal principle which makes,
    according to its strength, things dark and bright.

PARADISO III

The First Heaven. The Moon. Reflected Happiness

Inconstant Spirits who failed to keep their Vows

    That sun which erst had warmed my heart with love,
    by proving and refuting, had revealed
    to me the pleasing face of lovely truth;
    and I, in order to confess myself
    corrected and assured, lifted my head
    as high as utterance of assent required.

    But, that I might behold it, there appeared
    a sight, which to itself so closely held me,
    that my confession I remembered not.

    Even as from polished or transparent glasses,
    or waters clear and still, but not so deep,
    that wholly lost to vision is their bed,
    the features of our faces are returned
    so faintly, that upon a pallid brow
    a pearl comes no less faintly to our eyes;
    thus saw I many a face that longed to speak;
    I therefore ran into the fault opposed
    to that which kindled love ’tween man and fount.

    As soon as I became aware of them,
    supposing they were mirrored images,
    to find out whose they were, I turned mine eyes;

    and seeing nothing, back again I turned them
    straight on into the light of my sweet Guide,
    whose holy eyes were glowing as she smiled.

    “Be not surprised” she said, “that I should smile
    at what is childish in thy present thought,
    since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,
    but, as its wont is, turneth thee in vain.
    Real substances are these whom thou perceivest,
    assigned here for a vow not wholly kept.
    Speak to them, then, and hear them, and believe;
    for from Itself the True Light which contents them,
    permits them not to turn their feet away.”

    And I addressed me to the shade which seemed
    most eager to converse, and I began,
    like one confounded by too great desire:

    “O well-created spirit, that in rays
    of life eternal dost that sweetness taste,
    which never is, untasted, understood,
    ’t will grateful be to me, if thou content me
    with thine own name, and thy companions’ lot.”

    Hence promptly and with laughing eyes she said:
    “Not otherwise doth our love lock its doors
    against a just desire, than that Love doth,
    who wills that all His court be like Himself.
    A virgin sister was I in the world;
    and if within itself thy mind look well,
    my being fairer will not hide me from thee,

    but thou wilt recognize that I ’m Piccarda,
    who, placed here with these other blessèd ones,
    am happy in the slowest moving sphere.
    Our wishes, which are only set on fire
    by that which is the Holy Spirit’s pleasure,
    rejoice in that our joy was willed by Him.
    And this allotment, which appears so low,
    is therefore giv’n to us, because our vows
    neglected were, and not completely kept.”

    Hence I to her: “In these your wondrous faces
    there shines I know not what that is divine,
    which from your old appearance changes you;
    hence in remembering you I was not quick;
    but what thou now dost tell me helps me so,
    that I more easily recall thy face.
    But, tell me, ye who here so happy are,
    are ye desirous of a higher place,
    that ye may see more friends, or make you more?”

    First with those other shades she smiled a little,
    and then replied to me so joyously,
    that she appeared to burn with love’s first fire:

    “Brother, love’s virtue sets our will at rest,
    and makes us wish for only what we have,
    and doth not make us thirsty for aught else.
    If higher we desired to be, our wishes
    would be discordant with the will of Him,
    who here discerneth us, which, thou wilt see,

    can in these circles not occur, if love
    be necessary to existence here,
    and if love’s nature thou consider well.
    Nay more, essential to this blessèd life
    it is, that we should be within the Will
    Divine, whereby our wills become one will;
    and so, even as we are, from grade to grade
    throughout this Realm, to all the Realm is pleasing,
    as to its King, who in His Will in-wills us;
    and His Will is our Peace; and that
    the Ocean is, whereunto moveth all
    that It creates, and all that Nature makes.”

    Clear was it then to me that every where
    in Heaven is Paradise, and yet the Grace
    of Good Supreme rains there in many ways.

    But as it happens that, if one food sate,
    and longing for another still remain,
    for one we ask, and one decline with thanks;
    even thus with word and act did I, to learn
    from her what was the nature of the web,
    whose shuttle she drew not unto its end.

    “High worth and perfect life in-heaven” she said,
    “a lady higher up here, in whose rule
    the robe and veil are worn, that, till death come,
    both watch and sleep they may beside that Spouse,
    who every vow accepts, which love conforms
    to that which pleases Him. To follow her,

    when I was but a girl I fled the world,
    and in her habit clothing me, I promised
    that I would keep within her order’s path.
    Thereafter men more used to ill than good,
    out of that pleasant cloister dragged me forth,
    and God knows what my life was after that.

    This other splendor also, which reveals
    itself to thee upon my right, and glows
    with all the radiance of this sphere of ours,
    takes to herself what of myself I say;
    a nun she was, and likewise from her head
    the shadow of the sacred veils was torn.
    But when she, too, was brought back to the world
    against her wishes and against good usage,
    she never from the heart’s veil freed herself.
    This is the splendor of the great Costanza,
    who by the second Wind of Swabia gave
    the third and final Power birth.” She thus
    addressed me, and thereat ‘Ave, Maria’
    began to sing, and, singing, disappeared,
    as through deep water heavy objects do.

    Mine eyes which followed after her as far
    as it was possible, on losing her,
    back to the mark of greater longing turned,
    and unto Beatrice reverted wholly;
    but she so flashed upon me, as I gazed,
    that first my sight endured it not; and this
    the slower made me in my questioning.

PARADISO IV

The First Heaven. The Moon. Reflected Happiness

Inconstant Spirits who failed to keep their Vows

    A free man, ’tween two viands equally
    attractive and removed, would die of hunger,
    before he carried either to his teeth;
    thus would a lamb, between the ravenings
    of two fierce wolves, keep fearing each alike;
    thus would a dog remain between two does.

    Hence, by my doubts impelled in equal measure,
    if I was silent, I reproach me not,
    nor do I praise, since thus it had to be.
    I held my peace; but my desire was painted
    upon my face, and far more warmly thus
    I asked, than had it been by uttered speech.

    Hence Beatrice did ev’n as Daniel once,
    when in Nebuchadnezzar he appeased
    the wrath, which had unjustly made him cruel;
    and “Clearly do I see” she said, “how both
    thy wishes so attract thee, that thy thought
    is so self-bound, that it is not expressed.
    Thou arguest thus: ‘If my good will endure,
    why doth the violence of others cause
    the measure of my merit to be less?’

    Again it gives thee cause for doubt, that souls
    seem to return unto the stars again,
    according to the opinion Plato held.
    These are the questions which upon thy will
    are thrusting equally; I’ll hence deal first
    with that one which hath most of venom for thee.

    Of all the Seraphs he who most in-Gods
    himself, or Moses, Samuel, or, I say,
    whichever John thou choose, or even Mary,
    have in no other heaven their seats, than have
    those spirits which appeared to thee just now,
    nor for their being more or fewer years;
    but all make beautiful the highest sphere,
    and each in different ways enjoys sweet life,
    through feeling more and less the Eternal Breath.
    They did not here reveal themselves, because
    this special sphere had been allotted them,
    but to express the lowest heavenly state.

    Thus must one speak to your intelligence,
    since only from sense-objects can it learn
    what it thereafter fits for understanding.
    Because of this the Scriptures condescend
    to your capacity, and feet and hands
    ascribe to God, and yet mean something else;
    and Holy Church in human form presents
    Gabriel and Michael to you, and the other,
    who to Tobias once restored his health.

    That which Timaeus teaches of the soul
    is not like that which one up here beholds,
    for, as he says it, so he seems to mean.
    He says that each soul to its star returns,
    because he thinks that it was severed thence,
    when Nature granted it as form; and yet
    his doctrine is, perhaps, of other guise,
    than what his words imply, and may possess
    a meaning which is not to be despised.
    In case he mean that to these wheel-like spheres
    returns their influence’s praise or blame,
    his bow may hit, perhaps, upon a truth.
    This principle, ill understood, once turned
    nigh all the world awry, so that, in naming
    Jove, Mercury and Mars, it went astray.

    The other doubt whereby thy mind is stirred,
    less venom hath, because its harmfulness
    could not conduct thee elsewhere from my side.
    That this our Justice should appear to be
    unjust in the eyes of mortals, argues faith,
    and not heretical depravity.
    But here, because your human understanding
    can penetrate this truth with ease, I’ll now,
    as thou desirest, render thee content.

    If violence it be, when he who suffers
    contributes naught to him who uses force,
    these souls were not excused because of that;

    for will, unless it willeth, is not quenched,
    but acts as Nature acts in fire, though turned
    a thousand times aside by violence;
    for, whether it be bent or much or little,
    it yieldeth to the force; and so did these,
    when able to regain the holy place.
    For if their will had been as absolute
    as that which held Lorenzo on his grate,
    or that which to his hand made Mutius cruel,
    it would, as soon as freed, have urged them back
    along the road o’er which they once were dragged;
    but wills as firm as that are very rare!
    And by these words, if thou hast gathered them,
    as it behooved thee to, that doubt is quashed,
    which often would have troubled thee again.

    But now athwart thine eyes another pass
    appears, one such, that from it by thyself
    thou wouldst not issue, but wouldst weary first.
    I surely have instilled this in thy mind,
    that spirits who are happy could not lie,
    since such are always near the Primal Truth;
    yet from Piccarda thou mayst next have heard
    that Constance for the veil retained her love;
    she, therefore, seems to contradict me here.
    Oft hath it happened, brother, heretofore,
    that, to escape from danger, one has done,
    against one’s will, what was not right to do;

    as, at his father’s hest, Alcmaeon did,
    who impious made himself, his mother killing,
    in order not to fail in piety.
    In such a case I’d have thee think that force
    mingles with will, and that they so behave,
    that sinful actions cannot be excused.
    Absolute will consenteth not to wrong,
    but in so far consenteth, as it fears,
    unless it yield, to be more greatly harmed.
    Hence, when Piccarda puts the matter thus,
    she means it of the will that ’s absolute,
    and of the other I; hence both speak true.

    Such was the rippling of the holy stream,
    which issued from the Fount whence every truth
    derives; and such, it set both doubts at rest.

    “O thou belovèd of the Primal Lover,
    O goddess,” said I then, “whose speech both warms
    and inundates me so, that more and more
    it quickens me with life, not deep enough
    is mỳ love to return thee grace for grace;
    but let Who sees and can, provide for this.
    I well see that our mind is never sated,
    unless it be illumined by the Truth,
    outside of which no truth extends. Therein
    it rests, as doth a wild beast in its lair,
    as soon as it attains it; and it can
    attain it; else would all desires be vain.

    Hence like a shoot doubt rises at the foot
    of truth; and this is Nature, which from height
    to height impels us toward the mountain’s top.

    This biddeth me, and this assurance gives me,
    Lady, with reverence to inquire of you
    about another truth that ’s dark to me.
    I wish to know if one can so content you
    for broken vows by means of other things,
    that these shall not prove light upon your scales.”

    Then Beatrice looked at me with her eyes
    filled so divinely with the sparks of love,
    that, overcome, my vision turned in flight,
    and I with bowed eyes almost lost myself.

PARADISO V

The First Heaven. The Moon. The Second Heaven. Mercury

The Happiness of Beneficent Activity. Ambitious Spirits

    “If in the heat of love I flame on thee
    beyond the measure which is seen on earth,
    and vanquish thus the power of thine eyes,
    wonder thou not thereat, for this proceeds
    from perfect sight, which, as it sees, directs
    its feet to penetrate the good perceived.
    I clearly see that in thine intellect
    the Light Eternal is already shining,
    which, if but seen, always enkindles love;
    and if aught else seduce the love of men,
    ’t is nothing but some vestige of that Light,
    which there, ill-recognized, is shining through.
    Thou now wouldst know if for an unkept vow,
    one could with other service pay enough,
    ’gainst prosecution to ensure the soul.”

    ’T was thus that Beatrice began this canto;
    and ev’n as one who cuts not short his speech,
    her holy argument continued thus:

    “The greatest gift which, of His bounty, God
    bestowed, when He created, and the nearest
    like His own Goodness, and the one most prized

    by Him, was Freedom of the Will,
    wherewith all creatures with intelligence,
    and they alone, both were and are endowed.
    Now, if from this thou argue, thou ’lt perceive
    a vow’s high value, if so made it be,
    that God gives His consent, when thou giv’st thine;
    for when this pact is closed ’tween God and man
    a sacrifice is made of this great treasure,
    whereof I speak, and made by its own act.
    What, then, in compensation can be given?
    In thinking thou canst use thine offering well,
    good wouldst thou do with wrongly gotten gain.

    On the chief question thou art now informed;
    but since in this thing Holy Church exempts,
    which seems against the truth I showed to thee,
    a little longer must thou sit at table,
    because the solid food which thou hast taken,
    requires for thy digestion further help.
    Open thy mind to what I now reveal,
    and fix it therewithin; for having heard
    without retaining doth not knowledge make.

    In the essence of this sacrifice two things
    combine; one, that whereof the sacrifice
    is made; the other is the pact itself.
    This last can never cancelled be, except
    by being kept; and very definite
    concerning this is what was said above.

    The Hebrews, therefore, were alone compelled
    to make an offering, though their offer might,
    in some events, be changed, as thou must know.
    The other, which thou knowest as its matter,
    may well be such, that there will be no sin,
    if for some other matter it be changed.

    But at his own free will let no one shift
    the burden he has placed upon his back,
    unless the white and yellow Keys are turned;
    and let him deem all permutations foolish,
    unless the thing abandoned be contained
    in that which is assumed, as four in six.
    Whatever, then, weighs by its worth so much,
    that it can cause all scales to tip, can not,
    by any other spending, be made good.

    Let mortals not act lightly with their vows!
    Be faithful, and in this thing be not thoughtless,
    as Jephthah was, when offering up ‘the first,’
    who should have said: ‘I wrongly did,’ than keep
    his vow, and so do worse; and thou mayst deem
    as impious that great leader of the Greeks,
    because of whom Iphigenìa mourned
    for her fair face, and for herself made fools
    and wise men weep, who heard of such a rite.

    Ye Christians, be more serious when ye act!
    Be not like feathers in all winds, nor think
    that any water will avail to cleanse you!

    Ye have the Testaments, both Old and New,
    to guide you, and the Shepherd of the Church;
    let this for your salvation be enough.
    If evil greed should teach you otherwise,
    be men, and not like undiscerning sheep,
    that in your midst no Jew may laugh at you.
    Nor do as doth a little lamb, that leaves
    its mother’s milk, and like a wanton fool,
    against itself for its own pleasure fights.”

    Thus Beatrice to me, even as I write;
    then full of eagerness she turned in that
    direction, where the world is most alive.
    Her silence and her change of countenance
    silence imposed upon my eager mind,
    which had ahead of it new questions now.

    Then as an arrow doth, which strikes the mark,
    before the bowstring is at rest, even so
    did we speed on into the second realm.

    So joyous did I see my Lady there,
    as into that heaven’s light she entered, that,
    because of it, the planet brighter grew.
    And if the star was changed and smiled, what, then,
    did I become, who, by my very nature,
    in all ways am susceptible of change!

    As in a fishpond which is still and clear,
    the fish draw near to that which from without
    so cometh, that they take it for their food;

    I thus saw far more than a thousand splendors
    approaching us, and there was heard in each:
    “Lo, here is one, who shall increase our loves.”
    And as each one came up to me, the shade
    was seen replete with joy within the bright
    effulgence issuing from its midst.

    Think, Reader, if what here is entered on
    should not proceed, how full of pain would be
    thy craving to know more; and by thyself
    thou ’lt see how great was my desire to hear
    from these, about the state of their existence,
    as soon as to mine eyes they were revealed.

    “O well-born spirit, to whom Grace permits
    to see the thrones of Heaven’s eternal triumph,
    ère thy life militant be left behind,
    we by the light throughout all Heaven diffused
    are kindled; hence, wouldst thou inform thyself
    respecting us, be sated at thy will.”

    Thus was it said to me by one of those
    kind spirits; and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak,
    with freedom, and, as thou wouldst gods, believe!”

    “I clearly see how thou in thine own light
    dost nest thyself, and from thine eyes dost flash it,
    they beam so radiantly, when thou dost smile;
    but who thou art I know not, nor why thou,
    deserving soul, hast that sphere’s grade, which veils
    itself from mortals with another’s rays.”

    Thus I, when I had turned me toward the light
    which had addressed me first; far brighter then
    it made itself than it had been before.

    As doth the sun, which by exceeding splendor
    itself conceals itself, whene’er its heat
    has gnawed away the tempering of dense mists;
    so by increase of joy that holy form
    in its own radiance hid itself from me;
    and, wholly thus wrapped up, in such a way
    replied to me, as sings the following song.

PARADISO VI

The Second Heaven. Mercury. The Happiness of Beneficent

Activity. Ambitious Spirits

    When Constantine had turned the Eagle back,
    counter the course of heaven its flight pursued
    behind the Ancient who Lavinia wedded,
    a hundred and a hundred years and more
    the Bird of God on Europe’s verge abode,
    hard by the mountains whence it issued first;
    and ’neath the shadow of its sacred plumes
    it governed there the world from hand to hand,
    and, changing thus, reached mine. Caesar I was,
    and am Justinian, he, who by the will
    of that First Love which now I feel, withdrew
    the useless and excessive from the laws.
    And I, before attending to this work,
    believed that Christ one only nature had,
    not more, and was with such a faith content;
    but blessèd Agapètus, who was then
    the highest Shepherd, set me by his words
    upon the pathway of the genuine faith.
    Him I believed, and what was in his faith
    I now see clearly, even as thou dost see
    that contradictions are both false and true.

    As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,
    God, of His Grace, with that great task was pleased
    to inspire me, and thereto I gave me wholly;
    war to my Belisarius I entrusted,
    to whom Heaven’s right hand was so well conjoined,
    it seemed a sign that from it I should rest.

    Here, then, to thy first question ends my answer;
    its nature, though, constrains me to go on
    with something more,
    that thou mayst see how rightly
    against the holy Standard moves both who
    appropriates, and who opposes, it.

    See what great virtue caused it to deserve
    respect; for from that moment it began,
    when Pallas died to give it sovereignty.
    Thou knowest that in Alba it sojourned
    three hundred years and more, till finally
    three against three fought for its sake again;
    thou knowest, too, what from the Sabines’ wrong,
    through seven kings, till Lucretia’s grief, it did,
    conquering the neighboring peoples all around.
    Thou knowest what it did, ’gainst Brennus borne,
    and Pyrrhus, and against the other Kings
    and self-ruled States, by Rome’s elect, whereby
    Torquatus, Quinctius, for his unkempt locks
    surnamed, the Decii and Fabii,
    acquired the fame which gladly I embalm.

    It brought the pride of those Arabians low,
    who traversed, in the wake of Hannibal,
    those Alpine rocks, whence thou, Po, glidest down.
    Scipio and Pompey triumphed under it
    when young; and bitter to that hill it seemed,
    beneath which thou wast born. Then, near the time
    when willed it was by Heaven, that all the world
    should be reduced to its own peaceful state,
    Caesar assumes it at the hest of Rome.
    And that which from the Var unto the Rhine
    it did, the Saône, Isère and Seine perceived,
    and every valley whence the Rhone is filled.
    What next it did, when, issuing from Ravenna,
    it leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight,
    that neither tongue nor pen could follow it.
    Toward Spain it wheeled its host around; then turned
    Durazzo-ward; and smote Pharsalia so,
    that to the torrid Nile the pain was felt.
    Antandros and the Sìmois, whence it started,
    it saw again, and there where Hector lies;
    then, ill for Ptolemy, it roused itself.
    Thence with the speed of lightning it swooped down
    on Juba: toward your West it next turned back,
    for there it heard Pompeian trumpets blow.
    For what it did with its next Standard-bearer,
    Brutus, and Cassius with him, barks in Hell;
    Mòdena and Perugia, too, it grieved.

    Sad Cleopatra, who, before it fleeing,
    took from the asp a dark and sudden death,
    is weeping still for what with him it did.
    With him it reached the distant Red Sea’s shore;
    with him it brought the world to such a state
    of peace, that Janus had his temple closed.
    But what the Sign which causes me to speak,
    had done before, and after was to do,
    throughout the mortal world which owns its sway,
    comes to seem small and dark, if in the hand
    of its third Caesar it be looked upon
    with clearly seeing eyes and spirit pure;
    because the Living Justice which inspires me,
    granted that Sign, when in the latter’s hand,
    the glory of carrying out its wrath’s revenge.
    Now wonder here at what I further tell thee:
    when this was done, with Titus it ran on
    to avenge the avenging of the ancient sin.
    And later, when the tooth of Lombardy
    the Holy Church had bitten, Charles the Great
    came to her help by conquering ’neath its wings.

    Thou now canst judge of those I charged above,
    and of their sins, which all your woes produced.
    Against the public Standard one sets up
    the yellow Fleur-de-lys, while yet another
    appropriates it to a party’s use;
    hence hard it is to see which sinneth most.

    Let, then, the Ghibellines their tricks perform
    under some other sign; for this one he
    e’er follows ill, who it from justice parts!
    Nor let this new Charles smite it with his Guelfs,
    but let him rather fear the taloned claws,
    which from a greater lion once stripped off
    his hide! Often have sons ere now bewailed
    their father’s guilt; hence let none think that God
    will for his Lilies change His Coat-of-arms!

    This little star of ours adorns itself
    with those good spirits who have active been,
    that fame and honor might live after them;
    and when, thus deviating, one’s desires
    tend thitherward, the rays of true love needs
    must upward mount with less intensity.
    But in the balancing of our rewards
    with our deserts, part of our joy consists,
    because we see them as nor more nor less.
    Hereby the Living Justice sweetens so
    our love in us, that it can nevermore
    be turned aside to any kind of wrong.
    Voices that differ make on earth sweet music;
    so in this life of ours its different grades
    produce sweet harmony among these spheres.

    And in the present pearl there shines the light
    of Romeo, he whose beautiful and great
    performance was ungratefully repaid.

    And yet the Provençals who ’gainst him worked,
    laugh not; he, therefore, takes an evil path,
    who to his harm another’s good deeds turns.
    Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,
    had Raymond Berenger; and, though low-born
    and alien, Romeo ’t was did this for him;
    then slandering words led Raymond to demand
    a reckoning of this upright man, who five
    and seven had rendered him for every ten.
    Thereat, though poor and old, he went his way;
    and if the world but knew the heart he had,
    while crust by crust he begged his livelihood,
    much as it praises, it would praise him more!”

PARADISO VII

The Second Heaven. Mercury. The Happiness of

Beneficent Activity. Ambitious Spirits

    “Hosanna, O Thou Holy God of Hosts,
    that with Thy Clarity dost brighter make
    the happy fires of these celestial realms!”

    As thus to his own song he turned himself,
    by me that substance was seen singing now,
    o’er which a double light two-folds itself;
    and to their dance both that one and the rest
    addressed themselves; and then, like swiftest sparks,
    with sudden distance veiled themselves from me.

    In doubt I was, and to myself kept saying:
    “Tell, tell it to her; tell” I said, “my Lady,
    who with her sweet distillings slakes my thirst!”

    That reverence, though, which masters all of me
    by the mere syllables of be and ìce,
    bowed me like one that ’s overcome by sleep.
    A short while Beatrice endured me thus;
    then, lighting up my face with such a smile,
    as, even in fire, would bless one, she began:

    “As I am unmistakably aware,
    how a just vengeance could have been avenged
    with justice, hath occasioned thee to doubt;

    but I shall quickly liberate thy mind;
    hence listen, for my words will now bestow
    on thee the present of a mighty truth.

    By not accepting for the power that wills
    a helpful curb, the man who was not born,
    damning himself, damned all his progeny;
    wherefore the human race lay sick below
    in serious sin for many centuries,
    until the Word of God was pleased descend
    to where the nature, which had wandered far
    from its Creator, to His Self He joined,
    by the mere act of His Eternal Love.

    Now turn thy sight to what is argued now!
    This nature, thus united to its Maker,
    was, as when first created, pure and good;
    but through its own fault was in banishment
    exiled from Paradise, because it turned
    out of the path of truth and its own life.
    As to the suffering, therefore, which the cross
    afforded, none so justly ever bit,
    if measured by the nature thus assumed;
    and likewise none was ever so unjust,
    considering who the person was that suffered,
    within whom such a nature was conjoined.
    From one act, therefore, issued things diverse;
    for one same death pleased both the Jews, and God;
    it caused the earth to quake, and opened Heaven.

    No longer strange should it appear to thee
    henceforth, when it is said a just revenge
    was by a just court afterward avenged.

    But I perceive that now, from thought to thought,
    thy mind is in a knot tied up, from which
    with great desire it seeks to free itself.
    Thou sayest: ‘What I hear I clearly see;
    but from me hidden is why God should will
    for our redemption just this way alone.’
    Buried, my brother, lieth this decree
    from all men’s eyesight, whose intelligence
    hath not in love’s flame reached maturity.
    However, inasmuch as on this mark
    great is the gazing, and but little seen,
    I ’ll say why this one was the worthiest way.

    Goodness Divine, which spurneth from Itself
    all envy, burning in Itself, so sparkles,
    that Its eternal beauties It displays.
    Whatever from It is immediately
    distilled, hath afterward no end; for when
    It sets Its seal, Its stamp is not removed.
    Whatever from It is immediately
    rained down, is wholly free, for that lies not
    under the power of secondary things.
    Since most like It, it gives It greatest pleasure;
    because the Holy Fire which lighteth all things,
    is brightest in what most resembles It.

    The human creature is by all these things
    advantaged; hence, if one of them be lacking,
    it needs must fall from its nobility.
    Nothing but sin deprives it of its freedom,
    and maketh it unlike the Highest Good,
    hence little is it whitened by Its Light;
    and to its dignity it ne’er returns,
    unless, where sin has emptied, it fill up,
    for evil pleasures, with just penalties.
    When in its seed your nature wholly sinned,
    it was of all these dignities deprived,
    as well as banished far from Paradise;
    nor could they be regained by any path,
    if with due subtlety thou pay attention,
    except by crossing one of these two fords:
    either that of His courtesy alone,
    God should forgive it, or that by itself
    mankind should for its folly make amends.

    Fixed as attentively upon my words
    as thou art able, thrust thou now thine eye
    within the Eternal Counsel’s deep abyss!

    Since finite, man could never make amends,
    because unable in humility,
    by new obedience, to descend as far,
    as, disobeying, he had meant to mount;
    and this the reason is why man was barred
    from making satisfaction by himself.

    It, hence, behooved that God by His own ways
    should reinstate man in his perfect life,
    by one, I mean, or else by both at once.
    But since so much more grateful is the work
    a workman does, the more it represents
    the goodness of the heart from which it comes,
    Goodness Divine, which on the world imprints
    Its seal, was pleased to move by all Its paths
    to raise you up again. Nor hath there been,
    nor will there ever be, by either way,
    between the first of days and last of nights,
    so high and so magnificent a plan;
    for God was far more bountiful in giving
    Himself, to make man fit to raise himself,
    than had He only of Himself forgiven;
    therefore all other means had fallen short
    of Justice, if the Son of God had not
    humbled Himself, incarnate to become.

    But, wholly to fulfill thine every wish,
    I ’ll now go back to clarify one point,
    that thou mayst see as plainly there as I.

    Thou say’st: ‘I see that water, nay, I see
    that fire and air and earth, and all their mixtures
    become corrupt, and but a little while
    endure; and yet created things were these!
    If, therefore, what was said above were true,
    safe from corruption ought these things to be.’

    The Angels, brother, and the perfect world,
    in which thou now art, may be called created,
    such as they are, in their perfected state;
    the elements, however, thou hast named,
    and those things which by means of them are made,
    by a created virtue are informed.
    Created was the matter which they have;
    created was the informing influence
    in all these stars, which round about them move.
    The rays and motion of the holy lights
    draw from pure matter’s potentiality
    the soul of every brute and every plant.
    But without agency doth Kindliness
    Supreme breathe your life forth, and with Itself
    enamors it so greatly, that thereafter
    it always longs for It. And, furthermore,
    thou canst from this infer your resurrection,
    if thou recall how human flesh was made,
    when both of man’s first parents were created.”

PARADISO VIII

The Third Heaven. Venus. The Happiness of Love

The Spirits of Lovers

    The world was at its peril wont to think
    that, in the third of epicycles circling,
    fair Cypria beamed her sensual love abroad;
    the ancient peoples, therefore, in their ancient
    error, with sacrifice and votive cry,
    honored not her alone, but with Diòne
    Cupid as well, the former as her mother,
    the latter as her son; and used to say
    that he had sat of old in Dido’s lap;
    and took from her, from whom I here begin,
    the name-word of the star, at which the sun
    looks fondly, now behind, and now in front.

    Of our ascending to it I was not
    aware; but that we in it were, my Lady,
    whom grown more fair I saw, assured me fully.
    And then, as in a flame a spark is seen,
    and as within a voice a voice is heard,
    when one remains and the other goes and comes;
    so I in that light other lamps beheld,
    whirling with greater speed or less, I think,
    according to each lamp’s eternal vision.

    Out of cold clouds there ne’er descended winds,
    or visible or not, so swiftly moving,
    that they would not appear restrained and slow
    to one who had perceived those lights divine
    draw near to us, when they had ceased the circling,
    among the exalted Seraphs first begun.
    And in the foremost to appear, “Hosanna”
    resounded so, that I have never since
    lacked the desire of hearing it again.

    One then drew nearer to us, and alone
    began: “We all are ready at thy pleasure,
    that thou mayst have thy joy of all of us.
    In one ring, with one circling and one thirst,
    we with the heavenly Principalities
    revolve, to whom once from the world thou saidst:
    ‘Ye who the third heaven by your knowledge move;’
    and we ’re so full of love, that, thee to please,
    a little quiet will not seem less sweet.”

    After mine eyes had toward my Lady turned
    with reverent questioning, and she herself
    had with herself contented and assured them,
    back toward the light they turned, which of itself
    had made such promise, and “Who are ye, say?”
    was what I voiced with great affection toned.

    And how much greater did I see it grow,
    in size and quality, with that new joy,
    which, when I spoke, was added to its joys!

    Grown thus, it said to me: “The world below
    had me not long; but had it done so longer,
    much evil that will be, would not have been.
    The gladness which around me radiates,
    and, like a creature by its own silk swathed,
    conceals me here, now keeps me hidden from thee.
    Much didst thou love me, and good cause hadst thou
    therefor; since, had I been on earth, much more
    would I have shown thee than the leaves of love.

    That left-hand bank, which by the Rhone is washed,
    just after it has mingled with the Sorgue,
    looked in due time to have me as its lord;
    as did the Ausonian horn, which is with Bari,
    Gaèta and Crotona towned, and whence
    the Tronto and Verde pour into the sea.
    Upon my brow already blazed the crown
    of that land which the Danube irrigates,
    when it abandons its Germanic banks;
    and fair Trinacria, which grows dark with smoke
    between Pachynus’ and Pelorus’ capes
    over the gulf which Eurus vexes most,
    not through Typhoèus, but through nascent sulphur,
    would still be waiting for its kings, through me
    from Charles and Rudolph sprung,
    had not ill rule,
    which always angers subject peoples, stirred
    Palermo to the point of shouting: “Die!”

    And did my brother but foresee this now,
    the greedy poverty would he avoid
    of Catalonia, that it harm him not;
    for verily provision must be made
    by him, or by another, that no load
    be further laid upon his burdened bark.
    His nature, which descended mean from one
    which liberal was, would such retainers need,
    as would not care to fill their coffers up.

    “Since I, my lord, believe the joy profound
    thy speech infuses in me, is by thee
    perceived, where every good thing both begins
    and ends, as I perceive it, all the more
    grateful it is; and I am also glad
    that this thou see’st by looking up at God.
    As thou hast made me happy, make it clear,
    for thou hast moved me by thy words to doubt,
    how out of sweet seed bitter seed can spring.”

    This I to him; and he: “If I can show
    a truth to thee, to that which thou dost ask
    thou ’lt hold thy face, as thou dost now thy back.

    The Good which turns and sateth all the Realm
    through which thou mountest, makes His providence
    a power within these mighty bodies here;
    and not alone are natures in that Mind
    foreseen, which of Its own self perfect is,
    but they themselves, and with them their well-being;

    hence, all this bow shoots forth falls predisposed
    unto an end foreseen, as would an arrow
    aimed at its destined mark. Were this not so,
    the heaven through which thou now art journeying,
    in such a way would its effects produce,
    that ruins they would be, not works of art;
    nor can this be, unless the Intellects
    which move these stars are faulty, and the First,
    who failed to make them perfect, faulty, too.
    Wouldst have this truth become more white for thee?”

    And I: “No, truly, for I see that Nature,
    in what is needful, cannot get fatigued.”

    Then he: “Now say: would it be worse on earth
    for man, if he were not a citizen?”

    “Yes,” I replied, “nor do I here ask why.”

    “And can he be, unless men there below
    in different ways for different functions live?
    No, if thereon your teacher writeth well.”

    So far he came, deducing thus; then closed:
    “Because of this the roots of your effects
    must different be; hence one is Solon born,
    Xerxes another, and Melchisedech
    another, and another he, who lost his son
    while flying through the air. Revolving Nature,
    which is a seal to mortal wax, performs
    her function well, but no distinction makes
    ’tween one and any other dwelling-place.

    It hence results that Esau in his seed
    differs from Jacob, while Quirinus comes
    from such a common father, that ascribed
    to Mars he is. A generated nature,
    unless divine foresight prevailed, would always
    follow along its generators’ path.
    Now that which was behind thee is before;
    but that thou know that thou dost give me pleasure,
    I ’d have a corollary mantle thee.

    Nature, whene’er she finds a destiny
    discordant with her, like all other seed
    in soil unsuited to it, always fails;
    and if the world down there but set its mind
    upon the basal plan which Nature lays,
    and followed it, ’t would have its people good.
    But to religion ye now wrest aside
    one that is born to gird him with a sword;
    and make a king of one that ’s fit to preach;
    the course ye take is, therefore, off the road.”

PARADISO IX

The Third Heaven. Venus. The Happiness of Love.

The Spirits of Lovers

    After thy Charles, fair Clemence, had resolved
    my doubts, he told me of the treacheries,
    his offspring were to undergo; and said:
    “Be silent now, and let the years roll by!”
    Hence I can only say to you that tears
    will justly follow on your people’s wrongs.

    And now the spirit of that holy light
    back to the Sun, which filleth it, had turned,
    as to the Good which sateth everything.

    Alas, ye souls deceived and impious creatures,
    who from such goodness tear your hearts away,
    and turn your temples unto vanity!

    And hereupon, another of those splendors
    in my direction came, and signified,
    by brightening outwardly, its wish to please me.
    The eyes of Beatrice, which, as before,
    were fixed upon me, gave me full assurance
    of her beloved assent to my desire.

    “Prithee, blest spirit, satisfy my wish
    at once,” I therefore said, “and give me proof
    that what I think, I can reflect in thee.”

    Whereat the light which still was new to me,
    out of its depths, whence it had sung before,
    went on, like one whom doing good delights:
    “In that part of Italia’s evil land,
    which ’tween Rialto’s island and the Brenta’s
    and Piave’s fountain-heads is situated,
    a hill ascends, nor rises very high,
    whence once a torch came down, which terribly
    assaulted all the country round about.
    From one same root both I and it were born;
    Cunizza called, I here refulgent am,
    because the light of this star vanquished me.
    But gladly I forgive myself the cause
    of my allotment here, which grieves me not;
    which to your common people might seem strange.

    Of this dear brilliant jewel of our heaven,
    which nearest is to me, a mighty fame
    remains behind; and, ere it die away,
    this hundredth year will yet quintupled be.
    See whether one should excellent become,
    so that the first may leave another life!
    But thus the present mob, the Adige’s
    and Tagliamento’s streams enclose, thinks not;
    nor doth it yet, though scourged by wars, repent.
    But at the Marsh ’t will happen soon that Padua
    will change the waters which Vicenza bathe,
    because its folk were restive to their duty.

    And where the Sile and Cagnano mate,
    one lordeth it and goes with head erect,
    for trapping whom even now the net is made.
    Feltro will yet bewail the faithlessness
    of its bad shepherd, which will be so foul,
    that Malta was not entered for the like.
    Too large would be the wine-vat which could hold
    all the Ferrara blood — and weary one
    who tried to weigh it ounce by ounce —
    which shall this courteous priest’s donation be,
    to prove his party loyalty; and gifts
    like this will with the country’s life conform.

    Mirrors there are above, (ye call them Thrones),
    whence on us God as Judge reflects His light;
    so that these words of ours seem good to us.”

    She here ceased speaking; then intent she seemed
    on something else, because she set herself
    to wheel around, as previously she did.

    The other joy, already known to me
    as something noble, in my sight became
    a perfect ruby smitten by the sun.
    Splendor up yonder is by joy acquired,
    as smiles are here; but down below a shade
    outwardly darkens, when the mind grows sad.

    “God seeth all,” I said, “and thy will so
    in-Hims itself, blest spirit, that no wish
    can rob thee of itself. Therefore thy voice,

    which, with the song of those devoted fires,
    who with their six wings make themselves a cowl,
    is always charming Heaven, why gives it not
    contentment to my wishes? I, indeed,
    would not await thy asking me, if I
    in-thee’d myself as thou in-me’est thee.”

    “The greatest valley o’er which water spreads”
    thereat his words began, “except the sea
    which forms a garland round the earth, extends
    counter the sun so far ’tween alien shores,
    that it can make meridian of a place,
    where it is wont to make horizon first.
    On that sea’s shore I dwelt, ’tween Ebro’s mouth
    and Magra’s, which, for but a short way, parts
    the Tuscan region from the Genoese.
    With almost equal set and rise of sun
    sits both Buggèa and the city whence
    I was, which with its blood once warmed its port.
    Folco that people called me, unto whom
    my name was known; and this heaven is by me
    impressed, as I was formerly by it;
    for Belus’ daughter, when she troubled both
    Sichaeus and Creùsa, burned no more
    than I, as long as it beseemed my hair;
    nor did that Rhodopean maid, whose love
    Demòphoön deceived, nor yet Alcides,
    while in his heart he kept Iole locked.

    Yet we are not repenting here, but smiling,
    not for the sin, which to our minds returns not,
    but for the Worth which ordered and foresaw.
    Here at the art we gaze which beautifies
    so great a work, and only see the Goodness
    whereby the world above turns that below.

    But so that thou mayst bear away with thee
    thy wishes all fulfilled, which in this sphere
    were born, still further must I needs proceed.
    Who is within this light, thou fain wouldst know,
    which right here at my very side is sparkling,
    as rays of sunlight shine in limpid water.
    Know, then, that Rahab finds her rest therein;
    and, to our order being joined, with her
    it stamps itself in a supreme degree.
    By this heaven, where the shadow your world makes
    ends in a point, before all other souls
    was she received, that triumph with the Christ.
    It well behooved to leave her in some heaven
    to be a palm of that great victory,
    which by both hands was won,
    because she favored
    Joshua’s first glory in the Holy Land,
    which little stirs the memory of the Pope.

    Thy town, which is a plant once sowed by him,
    who first against his Maker turned his back,
    and through whose envy many tears are shed,

    brings forth and spreads abroad the cursèd flower,
    which, having of the shepherd made a wolf,
    hath caused both sheep and lambs to go astray.
    The Gospels and great Doctors are for this
    despised; and only the Decretals conned,
    as is apparent by their margins’ state.
    On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;
    their thoughts turn not toward Nazareth, where Gabriel
    once oped his wings. But both the Vatican
    and all the other chosen parts of Rome,
    of old the burial place of that militia,
    which followed in the path which Peter trod,
    will soon be freed from this adultery.”

    Looking upon His Son with all the Love,
    which both of them eternally breathe forth,
    the Primal and Unutterable Power
    with so great order made whate’er revolves
    through mind or space, that none who look at it
    can ever be without a taste of Him.

    Lift, therefore, Reader, to the heavenly wheels
    thine eyes with me, directly to the region,
    where one of their two motions strikes the other;
    and there begin to contemplate with love
    that Master’s art, who in Himself so loves it,
    that never doth His eye abandon it.
    And now see how from thence the oblique ring,
    which bears the planets with it, branches off,
    to please the world which calls upon them; how,
    in case their path were not thus bent aside,
    in vain would be much virtue in the heavens,
    and dead well nigh all potencies down here;
    and how, if from the straight line, more or less
    removed, it swerved, much in the mundane order
    would lacking be below and up above.

    Now, Reader, on thy bench remain, and what
    is here foretasted, follow out in thought,
    if thou, e’er weary, wouldst be very glad.
    Food have I set before thee; feed thou now
    thyself; because the theme, whose scribe I ’m made,
    unto itself is wresting all my care!

    The greatest of the ministers of Nature,
    which with the power of Heaven imprints the world,
    and with its light measures our time for us,
    joined with the section touched upon above,
    was circling now around the spiral rings,
    wherein it earlier shows itself each day;
    and I was in it, but was not aware
    of my ascent, except as one, before
    a thought has come, is conscious of its coming.

    ’T is Beatrice, who thus from good to better
    conducts one with such swiftness, that her act
    extendeth not through time. In its own self
    how bright must that have been, which in the Sun,
    which I had entered, was not visible
    by color, but by light! Though I on genius,
    practice and art should call, I could not so
    describe it, that it e’er could be imagined;
    but it can be believed, and sight of it
    should be desired! And for such heights if low
    be our imagination, is no wonder;
    for no eye ever reached beyond the sun.

    Such the fourth family here of that Exalted
    Father, who ever states it by revealing
    how He breathes forth, and how He generates.

    And Beatrice began: “Give thanks, give thanks
    unto the Angels’ Sun, who, of His Grace,
    hath raised thee up to this material one!”

    No mortal heart was ever so disposed
    to be devoted, and with all its pleasure
    give itself up to God, as I became
    at those last words of hers; hence all my love
    set itself so on Him, that Beatrice
    in my forgetting mind became eclipsed.
    And she disliked it not, but smiled at it,
    so that the splendor of her laughing eyes
    shared with more things my undivided mind.

    I many keen and dazzling splendors saw,
    who, sweeter voiced than in appearance bright,
    made us a center and themselves a crown.
    Latona’s daughter we behold at times
    thus girded, when so pregnant is the air,
    that it retains the thread that forms her zone.
    Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,
    are many jewels found, so fair and precious,
    that from the Kingdom they may not be moved;
    and of these was the singing of those lights.
    Let him who doth not feather him to fly
    up there, await the dumb for news from thence.

    And then, when singing thus, those burning suns
    had all around us whirled themselves three times,
    like stars, that near unmoving poles revolve,
    ladies they seemed to me, who though not through
    with dancing, yet in silence stop a while, and list
    till they have caught the music’s coming notes.

    In one I heard beginning: “Since the ray
    of Grace, whereby true love is set on fire,
    and afterward, by dint of loving, grows
    and multiplies, is shining in thee so,
    that it conducts thee upward o’er the stairs
    which none without remounting e’er descends;
    he who thy thirst the wine within his flask
    refused, would be no more at liberty,
    than water is which falls not to the sea.

    Thou fain wouldst know what blooms this wreath enflowers
    itself withal, which, circling round her, woos
    the Lady fair who makes thee strong for Heaven.
    One of that holy flock’s young lambs was I,
    which Dominic leads along the path, whereon
    one thriveth well, if one go not astray.

    The nearest on my right here was my brother
    and teacher; he was Albert of Cologne,
    and Thomas of Aquinum I. If thus
    of all the other lights thou wouldst be sure,
    follow behind my speaking with thy face
    revolving upward round the blessèd wreath.

    That other flaming issues from the smile
    of Gratian, who to both the courts of law
    was such a help, that Paradise is pleased.

    The next, who at his side adorns our choir,
    that Peter was, who, like the needy widow,
    offered his treasure up to Holy Church.

    The fifth light, which is fairest in our midst,
    is with such love inspired, that all the world
    down there is hungry to have news of it.
    In it is that great mind, wherein was placed
    wisdom so deep, that if the truth be true,
    no second hath arisen to see so much.

    See next to it that candle’s light which saw
    most inwardly, when in the flesh below,
    the Angels’ nature and their ministry.

    In the next little light that advocate
    of Christian times is smiling, of whose work
    in Latin Augustine availed himself.

    If now thy mind’s eye thou art moving on,
    from light to light, behind my words of praise,
    thou now remainest thirsting for the eighth.
    Because it sees all good things, therewithin
    that holy soul rejoices, which reveals
    the cheating world to one who hears him well.
    Down yonder in Cieldauro lies the body,
    from which this soul was driv’n; and to this peace
    from martyrdom and banishment it came.

    Flaming beyond it see the burning breath
    of Isidore, of Bede, and of Riccardo,
    who was in speculation more than man.

    And this, from whom thy glance returns to me,
    the light is of a spirit, unto whom,
    in deep thoughts lost, it seemed that death came slowly.
    This is the light eternal of Sigièri,
    who, when he lectured in the Street of Straw,
    proved by his syllogisms displeasing truths.

    Then like a clock, which calls us at the hour,
    at which the Bride of God awakes to sing
    her Spouse a morning-song, and win His love,
    and as one part or draws or drives the other,
    and sounds ‘Ting, ting’ with such delightful notes,
    that spirits well disposed are filled with love;
    even so I saw that glorious circle move,
    and fuse its voices in a harmony,
    and with a sweetness, which can not be known,
    except where joy is self-eternalized.

PARADISO XI

The Spirits of Theologians and Philosophers. St. Francis

    O foolish care of mortal men, how full
    of fallacies the syllogisms, which cause thee
    over a nether course to beat thy wings!

    One given to legal learning went his way,
    one medicine, the priesthood one pursued,
    and lordship one, by force or sophistry;
    one practised theft, and public business one,
    one, in the pleasures of the flesh involved,
    was growing weary, one to idleness
    and ease was giving up his life, while I,
    from all these things set free, was up in Heaven
    with Beatrice so gloriously received.

    When each had to the point returned again,
    where in the ring he was before, he stayed there,
    still as a candle in a candle-stick.

    And I within the light which had before
    addressed me, heard one smilingly begin,
    as more and more resplendent it became:
    “As with Its radiance I am shining here,
    so I, by gazing at the Eternal Light,
    learn whence thou tak’st occasion for thy thoughts.

    In doubt, thou wouldst that I repeat, in words
    so clear and so distinct that they will suit
    thine understanding, that late speech of mine,
    wherein I said: ‘Whereon one thriveth well,’
    and where I said: ‘No second hath arisen;’
    for clearly must one needs distinguish here.

    The Providence, which with that counsel rules
    the world, whereby, before it reach the bottom,
    every created sight is overcome,
    in order that the Bride of Him, who cried
    aloud, and spoused her with His blessèd blood,
    might go toward her Delight, safe in herself,
    and unto Him more faithful, too, ordained
    in her behalf two Princes who should serve
    as guides to her on this side and on that.
    One, in his burning love, was all Seraphic;
    the other, by his wisdom, was on earth
    a splendor of Cherubic light. I ’ll speak
    of one of them, for both are spoken of,
    when one is praised, whichever one be taken,
    for to the same end were the deeds of both.

    Between Tupino and the stream that flows
    adown the hill which blest Ubaldo chose,
    a lofty mountain’s fertile slope impends,
    from which Perugia feels at Porta Sole
    both cold and heat; while, for their heavy yoke,
    behind it Gualdo and Nocera weep.

    Out of this hillside, where it breaketh most
    its steepness, to the world a sun was born,
    as out of Ganges this one is at times;
    therefore let him who talks about that place
    not say Ascesi, which were not enough;
    but Orient say, if he would rightly speak.
    Not distant from his rising was he yet,
    when he began to cause the world to feel
    somewhat encouraged by his wondrous virtue;
    for, still a youth, he strove against his father
    for such a Lady’s sake, that unto her,
    as unto death, none open pleasure’s door;
    and then, before his church’s legal court,
    and in his father’s presence, joined himself
    to her; and ever after day by day
    loved her the more intensely. She, bereft
    of her First Husband, slighted and scorned, remained
    unwooed eleven hundred years and more,
    till that one came; nor aught availed to hear,
    that he, whom all the world was fearing, found her
    undaunted, with Amyclas, by his voice;
    nor aught, her being so unmoved and firm,
    that ev’n when Mary stayed beneath it, she
    went up with Christ upon the cross.
    But now,
    lest in my long talk I proceed too darkly,
    take Poverty and Francis as these lovers.

    Their concord and their joyful countenance
    caused wonder, love and gentle looks to end
    in others’ holy thoughts; and so much so,
    that venerable Bernard was the first
    to bare his feet, and run behind such peace,
    and, running, feel that he was slow of foot.
    O wealth unrealized, O fertile goodness!
    Egidio bares his feet, Sylvester his,
    behind the groom, so pleasing is the bride!

    That father, then, and master went his way
    with both his Lady and that family,
    which now was girding on the humble cord;
    nor let base-heartedness weigh down his brow
    for being Peter Bernardòne’s son,
    nor yet for seeming so contemptible
    to others; but revealed his stern resolve
    to Innocent with royal dignity,
    and won from him his Order’s primal seal.
    When Poverty’s belovèd followers
    had grown behind the man, whose wondrous life
    would in the glory of Heaven be better sung,
    the holy purpose of this head of flocks
    was through Honorius by the Holy Spirit
    crowned with a second crown. Thereafter, when,
    by reason of his thirst for martyrdom,
    Christ and the rest, His followers, he had preached
    before the haughty Soldan; and, on finding

    his folk too restive to conversion, not
    to stay in vain, returned to pick the fruit
    of Latin fields; among the savage rocks,
    which ’tween the Tiber and the Arno rise,
    he took from Christ himself the final seal,
    which on his limbs he bore for two whole years.
    When Him it pleased, who granted him such weal,
    to draw him up to that reward, which he,
    by making himself lowly, had deserved,
    to his own brethren, as to rightful heirs,
    he recommended his most precious Lady,
    and ordered them to love her faithfully;
    then from her bosom his illustrious soul
    willed to depart, and to its realm returned,
    and for its body wished no other bier.

    Think now what he was, who, as his companion,
    was worthy deemed to keep the bark of Peter
    true to its course, when sailing on the deep!
    That was our Patriarch; thou, hence, canst see
    that he who follows him as he commands,
    loadeth his vessel with good merchandise.

    And yet his flock, so greedy for new food
    hath grown, that it can hardly fail to scatter
    through various wood and mountain pasture lands;
    and hence, the more his sheep like vagabonds
    wander away, and further go from him,
    emptier of milk do they regain the fold.

    Yet surely some there are, who, dreading harm,
    cling to their shepherd; but so few are these,
    that little cloth will furnish them with cowls.

    If, now, my words have not been indistinct,
    and if thy hearing hath attentive been,
    and thou recall to mind what I have said,
    partly contented will thy wishes be;
    because thou ’lt see the plant whence hewn they are,
    and what the limitation means: ‘Whereon
    one thriveth well, if one go not astray.”’

    As soon as e’er the blessèd flame had voiced
    its final word, the holy wheel began
    to whirl; and in its circling had not moved
    around completely, ere another wheel
    enclosed it in a ring, and each to each
    matched with its own its motions and its songs;
    songs which, in those sweet pipes, as far surpass
    our Muses and our Sirens, as a primal
    splendor surpasses one reflected from it.

    As when, both parallel and like in hue,
    two rainbows o’er a tender cloud are drawn,
    when Juno issues orders to her maid,
    the outer being from the inner born,
    as is the speaking of that wandering nymph,
    whom love consumed as mists are by the sun;
    and cause folk here, by reason of the pact
    which God with Noah made, to prophesy
    about the world, that it will not again
    be flooded; so, of those eternal roses
    the two wreaths turned around us there, and so
    the outer with the inmost harmonized.

    After the dance and great high feast of song,
    and flaming interplay of light with light
    in joyful happiness and tender love,
    had of a sudden and with one accord
    grown quiet, even as eyes do, which must close
    and open at the will of what attracts them;
    out of the heart of one of those new lights
    a voice came forth, as to its ‘where’ I turned,
    which made me seem a needle to its star.

    And it began: “The love which lends me beauty,
    draws me to talk about that other Leader,
    for whose sake mine is so well talked of here.
    Where one is, right it is to introduce
    the other; so that, since they fought together,
    their glories likewise may together shine.

    Christ’s host, which cost so much to arm anew,
    was slowly, timidly, and small in numbers
    moving behind its Standard, when the Emperor
    who ever reigns, provided, of His Grace
    alone, for His endangered host, and not
    because of its deserts; and helped His Bride,
    as it hath here been said, with champions twain,
    through whom, because of what they did and said,
    the people who had strayed away returned.

    In those parts where sweet Zephyr’s breezes rise
    to open spring-time’s foliage, wherewithal
    Europe is seen to clothe herself again,

    not very distant from the beating waves,
    behind which, through his long career, the sun
    conceals himself at times from every one,
    fortunate Calaroga hath her seat,
    guarded by that great shield, in which the lion
    both subjugates, and is subdued. Therein
    the amorous lover of the Christian Faith
    was born, the holy athlete, well disposed
    toward those he loved, and toward his foes severe;
    and even at its creation was his mind
    with such live virtue filled, that in his mother
    it caused her to become a prophetess.
    After the spousal ’tween the Faith and him
    had at the sacred font been held, where each
    with mutual health had dowered each, the lady
    who answered for him in a dream, beheld
    the wondrous fruit, that was to come from him
    and from his heirs. And that he might by name
    be what he was, a spirit went from hence,
    to give him the possessive of the One
    who wholly owned him.
    Dominic he was called;
    and of him as the husbandman I speak,
    whom Christ, to help him in His garden, chose.
    He truly seemed Christ’s messenger and servant,
    because the first love which appeared in him,
    was for the primal counsel given by Christ.

    Often was he discovered by his nurse
    lying awake and silent on the ground,
    as if he meant thereby: ‘I came for this.’
    O Felix, of a truth, his father was!
    O truly Joan, his mother, if it mean
    what it is said to, when interpreted!
    Not for the world’s sake, for which men now toil,
    following the man of Ostia, and Taddèo,
    but for the love of spirit-food, so great
    a teacher did he shortly make himself,
    that he began to go about the vineyard,
    which withers soon, if idle be the vintner;
    and of the Chair, which to the righteous poor
    was formerly more kind, not through its own,
    but through the fault of him who, sitting there,
    degenerates, he asked not for the right
    to give or two or three for six, nor yet
    the income of the earliest vacancy,
    nor even the tithes, which to God’s poor belong;
    but leave to fight against the erring world
    for that seed’s sake, whereof plants twenty-four
    are girding thee. With doctrine thereupon,
    and will, to apostolic sanction joined,
    he started, like a torrent by a high
    source urged, and on all stocks heretical
    his onset smote, and ever there most strongly,
    where strongest the resistance was. From him

    there afterward flowed divers streams, wherewith
    the garden Catholic is watered so,
    that all the fresher are its tender shrubs.

    If such was one wheel of the Car, whereby
    the Holy Church, herself defending, won
    the civil struggle in her own domain,
    the other’s excellence should certainly
    be very plain to thee, concerning whom
    Thomas so courteous was, ere I appeared.
    And yet the rut, formed by the highest part
    of its circumference, so forsaken is,
    that there where crust was, now is mould. His household,
    which started out aright, and kept their feet
    upon his footprints, hath so turned around,
    that that which is in front now treads on what
    was once behind; and this will soon be seen
    by the bad culture’s harvest, when the tares
    will of their loss of granaries complain.
    And yet I say that one who, page by page,
    should search our book, would still some paper find,
    where he could read: ‘What I was wont to be,
    I am;’ but from Casale he ’ll not come,
    nor yet from Acquasparta, whence such men
    approach the rule, that one evades, and one
    contracts its scope. Bonaventura’s life
    am I, of Bagnoregio, who in great
    positions set sinister cares behind.

    Here are Illuminàto and Aùgustin,
    who were among the first bare-footed poor,
    and, corded, made themselves the friends of God.
    Hugh of St. Victor here among them is,
    and Peter Mangiadòr, and Peter of Spain,
    who in a dozen books still shines on earth;
    Nathan the prophet, and metropolitan
    Chrysòstom, Anselm, aye, and that Donatus,
    who to the first art deigned to set his hand;
    Raban is here; and at my side is shining
    the abbot of Calabria, Joachim,
    who with prophetic spirit was endowed.

    The flaming courtesy of brother Thomas
    and his discerning speech have moved me thus
    to celebrate so great a paladin,
    and with me likewise moved this company.”

    Let him imagine, who would understand
    aright what now I saw, (and let him hold
    the image like a steadfast rock, the while
    I speak), the fifteen stars which vivify
    the sky at different points with such clear light,
    that vanquished is all denseness in the air;
    let him imagine next that Wain, whereto
    the bosom of our sky suffices so
    both night and day, that, as its pole revolves,
    it never disappears; and let him then
    imagine furthermore that trumpet’s mouth,
    which at the axle’s point begins, whereon
    the first wheel turns; and that all these had made
    two constellations of themselves, like that
    which Minos’ daughter fashioned when she felt
    the cold of death; and one to have its rays
    within the other, and both to so revolve,
    that one moved forward, and the other back;
    and he will of the actual constellation
    a shadow have, and of the double dance,
    which circled round the place where I then was;

    for it as far surpasses our experience,
    as swifter than the Chiana moves the heaven
    which outspeeds all the others. There they praised
    nor Bacchus nor Apollo, but three Persons
    in one sole nature, the divine, and that,
    in but one Person with the human joined.

    The song and dance completed each its measure;
    whereat those holy lights gave heed to us,
    rejoicing thus to pass from care to care.

    And then the light, wherein the wondrous life
    of God’s dear pauper had been told to me,
    of those harmonious gods the silence broke,
    and said: “Whereas one straw has now been threshed,
    and as its seed hath now been stored away,
    sweet love inviteth me to beat the other.

    Thou think’st that in the breast from which the rib
    was drawn, which went to form the lovely cheek,
    whose palate cost so much to all the world,
    and that in that one which, before and after
    the lance had pierced it, made such satisfaction,
    as to outweigh all sins,
    whatever light
    our human nature is allowed, the whole,
    was by that Power infused, which made them both;
    thou, hence, art marvelling at what above
    I said, when I narrated that the good
    enclosed within the fifth light had no second.

    Ope now thine eyes to what I answer thee;
    and thou ’lt see that my words and thy belief
    grow one in truth, as in a ring its center.

    That which dies not, and that which mortal is,
    are naught but that Idea’s reflected light,
    to which our Sire, by loving, giveth birth;
    for that Bright Light, which from its Lucent Source
    so flows, that It is not divided from Him,
    nor from the Love which with Them is intrined,
    out of Its goodness gathers up Its radiance,
    mirrored, as ’t were, in nine subsistences,
    Itself eternally remaining one.
    Thence to the lowest creatures It descends
    from act to act, and such becomes, that naught
    It makes but brief contingencies; and these
    contingencies I understand to be
    those generated things the moving heavens
    produce by means of seed and without seed.
    Of these the wax, and that which mouldeth it,
    are not of one same kind; hence, underneath
    the ideal stamp, they more or less reflect it;
    it hence results that, after its own kind,
    one selfsame plant bears better fruit and worse;
    and that with different natures ye are born.
    If tempered to perfection were the wax,
    and if the heavens were at their height of power,
    the whole light of the seal would be revealed;

    but Nature, working as an artist doth,
    who hath, though skilled and toward his art disposed,
    a trembling hand, e’er gives it with a flaw.
    Hence, if the Flaming Love dispose and stamp
    the Lucid Vision of the Primal Power,
    complete perfection is therein acquired.
    Thus rendered worthy of an animal’s
    complete perfection was the earth of old;
    thus also was the Virgin rendered pregnant;
    hence thine opinion I as true commend,
    that human nature never was, nor will be,
    such as it once in those two persons was.

    And now, if I no further went, ‘How, then,
    could he be peerless?’ would thy words begin.
    But, that what seems not so may now seem clear,
    think who he was, and what the cause which moved him
    in his request, when ‘Ask’ was said to him.
    I have not spoken so, that thou shouldst not
    see clearly that a king he was, who asked
    wisdom to be a worthy king; and not
    to know the number of the Angels here;
    nor whether from a necessary premise,
    with one contingent, a necessity
    e’er followed as result; nor yet to know
    if a first motion needs must granted be,
    nor whether a triangle could be made,
    with no right angle, in a semicircle.

    Hence, if thou note both what I said and this,
    a royal wisdom is that peerless vision,
    on which the shaft of my intention strikes;
    and if to ‘hath arisen’ thou direct
    clear eyes, thou ’lt see that it refers to kings
    alone, who many are, and few the good.
    With this distinction take thou what I said;
    for it can stand with that which thou believ’st
    of man’s first father, and of our Delight.

    And let this e’er be lead unto thy feet,
    to make thee, like one weary, slowly move
    to both the Yea and Nay thou seest not;
    for very low among the fools is he,
    who affirms without distinction, or denies,
    in one, as in the other, case; because
    it happens that a quickly formed opinion
    is often in a wrong direction turned;
    and then the feelings bind the intellect.
    For worse than vainly leaveth he the shore,
    who fishes for the truth and hath no skill,
    since, such as he set out, he comes not back;
    and in the world are patent proofs of this
    Parmenides, Melissus, Bryson, aye,
    and many who advanced, but knew not whither.
    So did Sabellius, Arius and those fools
    who to the Scriptures were as sword-blades are,
    in making faces crooked, which were straight.

    In judging, let not people be too sure,
    like him who in the field computes the ears,
    or ever they are ripe;
    for I have seen
    a thorn-bush seem all winter stiff and wild,
    and later bear a rose upon its top;
    and once I saw a vessel running straight
    and swiftly o’er the sea through all her course,
    and end by sinking at the harbor’s mouth.

    Let not dame Bertha or sir Martin think,
    on seeing one man rob, and one give alms,
    that they behold them as they seem to God;
    for that one may get up, and this one fall.”

PARADISO XIV

Mars. The Happiness of Heroism

    In rounded vessels water moves from rim
    to center, and from center so to rim,
    according as one strikes it from without
    or from within. What I am saying here
    fell suddenly into my mind, when once
    the glorious life of Thomas ceased to speak,
    because of the resemblance which arose
    between his speech and that of Beatrice,
    who, after him, was pleased to speak as follows:

    “This spirit needs, although he tells you so
    neither by voice, nor ev’n by thinking it,
    to reach the root of still another truth.
    Tell him, then, if the light, wherewith your substance
    is flowering, will remain with you the same
    eternally as even now it is;
    and if it still remain so, tell him how,
    when ye have been made visible again,
    it can be such as not to hurt your sight.”

    As when impelled and drawn by greater gladness,
    those who are dancing lift at times their voices,
    and give their actions greater sprightliness;

    so, at that prompt and reverent request,
    the holy circles showed new joyousness,
    both in their whirl and in their wondrous song.

    He that lamenteth that we die down here
    to live up yonder, hath not seen up there
    the comfort of the eternal rain. That One
    and Two and Three, who ever lives and reigns
    in Three and Two and One, uncircumscribed,
    and circumscribing everything, was there
    by each and all of yonder spirits sung
    with such a melody, that it would be
    a just reward for any one’s desert.

    And in the smallest ring’s divinest light
    I heard a gentle voice, like that with which,
    perhaps, the Angel spoke to Mary, answer:
    “As long as Paradise’s joy shall last,
    so long our love will radiate around it
    a garment such as this. Its clarity
    is patterned on our ardor, and our ardor
    upon our vision, and as keen is that,
    as is the grace it hath above its worth.
    When with our glorious and perfected flesh
    we ’re clothed again, our persons will give greater
    pleasure, because of being all complete;
    wherefore, whatever freely given light
    the Good Supreme may grant us, will increase —
    a light permitting us to see Him; whence

    our vision needs must grow; and grow the ardor
    which from it is enkindled, and hence grow
    the radiance, likewise, which proceeds from this.
    But as a burning coal emits a flame,
    and by its vivid glow surpasses it,
    so that its own appearance is maintained;
    so will this brightness which surrounds us now
    be vanquished in appearance by the flesh,
    which still is covered by the earth; nor will
    so great a light avail to weary us,
    because our body’s organs will be strong
    for whatsoe’er is able to delight us.”

    So quick and careful seemed both choirs to say
    ‘Amen!’, that clearly a desire they showed
    to have their buried bodies; and not, perhaps,
    for their own sakes alone, but for their mothers,
    and fathers and the others, who were dear
    to them, ere they became eternal flames.

    Then round us everywhere, of equal brightness,
    outside the luster there, another rose,
    like an horizon which is growing clear;
    and as new apparitions come in sight
    throughout the sky, at early evening’s rise,
    sò that one’s vision seems, and seems not, true;
    meseemed that new subsistences I there
    began to see, and that a ring was forming
    outside the other two circumferences.

    O thou true sparkling of the Holy Spirit!
    How suddenly and glowingly it flashed
    before mine eyes, which, vanquished, stood it not!

    But Beatrice revealed herself so fair
    and smiling, that this vision must be left
    ’mong those that followed not my memory.
    I hence gained strength to raise mine eyes again;
    and with my Lady alone I saw myself
    borne to a higher grade of blessedness.
    I well perceived that I was higher up,
    by reason of the star’s enkindled smile,
    which ruddier seemed to me than is its wont.

    With all my heart and with that kind of speech
    which is the same in all, I made to God
    such holocaust as was befitting this
    new grace; and the ardor of my offered self
    had not yet been exhausted from my breast,
    when I perceived that sacrifice was welcome
    and pleasing; for to me there then appeared
    splendors between two rays, so bright and red,
    that I exclaimed: “O Helios, who dost so
    adorn them!” As the Galaxy, bedecked
    with smaller and with greater lights, so glimmers
    ’tween the world’s poles, that even the wise are led
    to doubt; thus, constellated in the depths
    of Mars, those rays described the honored sign,
    which in a circle quadrant-joinings make.

    My memory overcomes my genius here;
    because that Cross so lightened forth the Christ,
    that I can find therefor no fit example;
    but whosoever taketh up his cross
    and follows Christ, will pardon me again
    for what I leave, when in that glow he sees
    the Christ flash forth. Lights moved about from arm
    to arm, and ’tween the summit and the base,
    and sparkled brightly when they met, and when
    they passed each other. Thus we here see, straight
    and crooked, swift and slow, and ever
    renewing their appearance, particles
    of bodies long and short, as through a ray
    they move, whereby at times that shade is streaked,
    which folk, to shield them, make with skill and art.

    And as a viol or a harp, attuned
    with many strings, a pleasant tinkling makes
    for one by whom the music is not caught;
    so from the lights which there appeared to me,
    a melody was gathered through the Cross,
    which rapt me, though I made not out the hymn.

    I well perceived it was of lofty praise,
    because ‘Arise!’ and ‘Conquer!’ came to me,
    as to who heard, but did not understand.

    So much in love with it did I become,
    that naught had ever fettered me before
    with such sweet bonds. My words, perhaps,

    appear too bold, in that they lower set
    the pleasure giv’n me by the lovely eyes,
    looking in which my longing finds its rest;
    but who considers that the living seals
    of all fair things do more, the higher up,
    and that I had not there looked up at them,
    may pardon me for what, to be excused,
    I ’m self-accused, and see that I speak true;
    for here the holy joy is not excluded,
    since, as it mounts, the purer it becomes.

    The kindly will, wherein is always shown
    the love which is by righteousness inspired,
    as greed is in the evil will revealed,
    silence imposed on that sweet singing lyre,
    and caused those holy chords to be at rest,
    which Heaven’s right hand slackens, and draweth tight.

    How shall those substances to righteous prayers
    be deaf, who ceased from song with one accord,
    to give me the desire to pray to them?
    ’T is well that he should boundlessly lament,
    who for the sake of that which lasteth not,
    deprives himself forever of that love.

    As through serene and quiet evening skies
    there darts from time to time a sudden fire,
    which startles tranquil eyes that were at rest,
    and seems to be a star which changes place;
    saving that naught is missing where it flashed,
    and that itself lasts but a little while;
    so, from the arm which to the right extends,
    down to that cross’s foot there ran a star
    drawn from the constellation shining there;

    nor from its ribbon did the gem depart,
    but through the radial band ran on, and looked
    like fire when back of alabaster moving.
    With like affection did Anchises’ shade
    reach forth, if our best Muse deserve belief,
    when in Elysium he perceived his son.

    “O thou my blood, O overflowing Grace
    of God, to whom, as unto thee, was e’er
    the Gate of Heaven unlocked a second time?”

    Thus spoke that light; hence I thereto gave heed;
    then to my Lady turning back my face,
    I was on this side and on that amazed;
    for such a smile was glowing in her eyes,
    that I with mine thought I had touched the depths
    both of my grace and of my Paradise.

    Thereat, a pleasure both to hear and see,
    the spirit joined to his beginning things
    I did not fathom, so profound his speech;
    nor did he hide himself from me by choice,
    but by necessity; for his conception
    set itself higher than a mortal’s aim.

    And when the bow of his impassioned love
    had so relaxed its tension, that his words
    descended to the level of our mind,
    the first thing that was understood by me
    was “Blest be Thou, that, Trine and One, hast been
    so courteous to my seed!” And he went on:

    “A pleasing and a long-protracted fast
    derived from reading in the Mighty Volume,
    wherein nor white nor dark is ever changed,
    hast thou relieved, my son, within this light
    in which I now address thee, thanks to her,
    who for the lofty flight hath feathered thee.
    Thou deemest that to me thy thoughts flow down
    from Him who Primal is, as from a one,
    if known it be, proceeds a five and six;
    yet who I am, thou dost not ask of me,
    nor wherefore I appear to thee more glad
    than any other in this joyous throng.
    Thou deemest what is true; because the small
    and great of this life at that Mirror gaze,
    wherein, before thou think, thou show’st thy thought.
    But that the holy love, wherewith I watch
    with sight perpetual, and which causes me
    to thirst with sweet desire, may be fulfilled
    the better, let thy voice, firm, bold, and glad,
    proclaim the will, proclaim the wish, whereto
    my answer has already been decreed!”

    To Beatrice I turned, and she had heard
    before I spoke, and smiled a nod to me,
    which caused the wings of my desire to grow.

    Then I thus: “When the First Equality
    revealed Himself to you, wisdom and love
    became for each of you of equal weight;

    because the Sun, whose heat and light illumed
    and warmed you, is of such equality,
    that all comparisons therewith are poor.
    But in the case of mortals, will and speech,
    because of reasons manifest to you,
    are differently feathered in their wings;
    hence I, who mortal am, now realize
    this inequality, and render thanks
    with heart alone to thy paternal greeting.
    I earnestly beseech thee, living topaz,
    set in this precious jewel like a gem,
    that with thy name thou make me satisfied.

    “O thou my leaf, in whom I pleasure took,
    while still awaiting thee, thy root I was.”
    He thus, as he replied to me, began;
    and then he said to me: “The one from whom
    thy family is named, and who hath circled
    the Mountain for a hundred years and more
    around the first ledge, was my son, and thy
    great-grand-sire; well behooveth it that thou
    shouldst shorten by thy works his long fatigue.

    Florence, within the ancient ring of walls,
    from which she still receives her tierce and nones,
    sober and modest still, abode in peace.
    No bracelets had she then, nor coronets,
    nor dames with ornamented shoes, or belts
    more likely to be looked at than themselves;

    nor did a daughter frighten yet at birth
    her father; for her marriage-age and dowry
    outran in neither way due measure yet.
    No houses had she void of families;
    nor yet had a Sardanapàlus come,
    to show us what could be achieved in halls.
    Not yet had Montemalo been surpassed
    by your Uccellatoio, which, outdone
    in its ascent, will be so in its fall.
    Bèllincion Berti going girt I saw
    with bone and leather, and his lady leave
    her looking-glass without a painted face;
    and Nerli’s lord I saw, and the Del Vecchio’s
    with unlined skins contented, and their dames
    with spindle and with thread.
    O lucky women!
    Sure of her burial place was each, and none
    as yet deserted in her bed for France.
    One stayed awake, absorbed in cradle cares,
    and used, in comforting, the speech which forms
    a father’s and a mother’s first delight;
    another, from her distaff drawing flax,
    repeated for her household olden tales
    about the Trojans, Fiesole and Rome.
    As great a marvel then would a Cianghella,
    or Lapo Salterello have been held,
    as Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.

    To such a calm and beautiful town life,
    to such a safe community, to such
    a pleasant inn, did Mary, called aloud,
    give me; and at the same time I became
    within your ancient baptist’ry a Christian,
    and Cacciaguida. Moronto was my brother,
    and Elisèo; from the Po’s valley came
    my lady to me, and from hèr name thine
    was formed. The Emperor Conrad afterward
    I followed, and among his chivalry
    he belted me a knight, by my good deeds
    I so obtained his favor. In his train
    I went against that law’s iniquity,
    whose people, through your shepherds’ fault, usurps
    your jurisdiction.
    There by that vile folk
    was I released from that deceitful world,
    the love of which debases many souls,
    and from my martyrdom attained this peace.”

PARADISO XVI

The Fifth Heaven. Mars. The Happiness of Heroism

The Old and the New Population of Florence

    O thou our small nobility of blood!
    That thou shouldst make some people boast of thee
    down here, where languid our affections are,
    will never be to me a wondrous thing;
    for there, where love turns not aside, in Heaven
    I mean, ev’n I myself was proud of thee.
    Thou truly art a cloak which soon grows short;
    so that from day to day, if thou be not
    patched out, time goes around thee with its shears.

    Hence with the “you,” which Rome the first endured,
    and in whose use her race least perseveres,
    my words began again; whence Beatrice,
    who at a little distance from me stood,
    by smiling here, resembled her who coughed
    at the first fault ascribed to Guinevere.

    “You are my father,” I began to say;
    “you to my speech complete assurance give;
    you so uplift me, that I ’m more than I.
    My mind is by so many brooklets filled
    with joy, that it congratulates itself
    that, without breaking, it can stand the strain

    Tell me, then, you my dear progenitor,
    who were your ancestors, and what the years
    which in your boyhood’s time were chronicled;
    and tell me of the sheepfold of St. John,
    how large it was, and who were in it then,
    that in the highest seats deserved to sit.”

    As at the breathing of the winds a coal
    is quickened into flame, ev’n so I saw,
    at my endearing words, that bright light glow;
    and to mine eyes as fairer it became,
    so with a gentler and a sweeter voice,
    but not in this our modern form of speech,
    it said to me: “From that day on, when ‘Hail’
    was uttered, to the child-birth when my mother,
    who now is sainted, was relieved of me
    who burdened her, this fire had to its Lion
    four hundred fifty and thirty times returned
    to light itself again beneath its paws.

    My first progenitors and I were born
    just there where first the town’s last ward is found
    by him who runneth in your annual race.
    Let of my forebears this suffice to hear;
    for as to who they were, and whence came hither,
    silence is more commendable than speech.

    All those that ’tween Mars’s statue and the Baptist
    who at that time were able to bear arms,
    were but the fifth of those that live there now;

    but then its citizens, who now with men
    from Campi, Certàldo and Figghìne mix,
    were in the lowest artisan seen pure.

    Oh, how much better it would be to keep
    as neighbors those to whom I here refer,
    and at Galluzzo and Trespiano mark
    our boundary, than have them in our town,
    and bear the stench of Aguglione’s churl,
    and Signa’s, who for graft hath sharpened eyes!

    If those who in the world are lowest fallen,
    had not step-mother-like to Caesar been,
    but kind, as to her son a mother is;
    one such is now a Florentine, and barters
    and trades, who would have turned to Semifonti,
    where formerly his grandsire mounted guard.
    The Conti still would own their Montemurlo,
    the Cerchi in Acone’s parish be,
    and in the Valdigreve still, perhaps,
    the Buondelmonti. Ever was the mixing
    of clans the fountain of the city’s woe,
    as of the body’s ill superfluous food;
    for sooner will a blinded bull succumb
    than will a blinded lamb, and one sword oft
    will cut both more and better than will five.

    If thou consider Luni and Urbisaglia
    how they have gone, and how now in their wake
    Chiusi and Sinigaglia go their way,

    it will not seem or strange for thee or hard,
    to hear how families degenerate,
    since even cities have their term of life.
    All your creations die, as well as you;
    but death conceals itself in some that long
    endure, while individual lives are short!
    And as the turning of the lunar sphere
    covers and bares earth’s shores without surcease,
    ev’n so doth Fortune deal with Florence; hence,
    it should not seem a wondrous thing to thee
    what I of those great Florentines shall say,
    whose fame is hidden in the folds of time.

    I saw the Ughi, and saw the Catellini,
    Filippi, Greci, Ormanni and Alberichi,
    though in decline, illustrious citizens;
    and I, as great as they were ancient, saw,
    with him of La Sanella, him of L’Arca,
    the Soldanieri, Ardinghi and Bostichi.
    Over the gate which is at present burdened
    with recent felony of such great weight,
    that there will soon be jetsam from the bark,
    the Ravignani dwelt, from whom there sprung
    Count Guido, and whoever since his time
    hath noble Bellincione’s name assumed.
    He of La Pressa knew already how
    to rule; and Galigàio in his house
    already had a gilded hilt and pummel.

    Mighty already were the Column of the Vair,
    Sachetti, Giuochi, Fifanti and Barucci,
    the Galli, and those that for the bushel blush.
    The stock whence the Calfucci sprang was great
    already; while already were the Sizii
    and Arigucci raised to curule chairs.
    And oh, how great I saw those now undone
    through arrogance! Then, too, the golden balls
    decked Florence forth in all her mighty deeds.
    So likewise fared the ancestors of those,
    who, when your church is vacant, always fatten
    by staying in consistory together.
    The haughty race, which like a dragon deals
    with those that flee, and unto those that show
    their teeth or purse, is peaceful as a lamb,
    was rising now, but from so low a clan,
    that Ubertin Donati was displeased,
    when by his own wife’s father made their kin.
    Already had the Caponsacco dropped
    from Fiesole into the Market, while,
    as townsmen, good were Guida and Infangato.
    I ’ll tell a thing incredible and true:
    the small ring then was entered by a gate,
    which from the della Pera took its name.
    Each one who bears that mighty Baron’s arms,
    whose name and whose renown the festival
    of Thomas keepeth green, received from him

    knighthood and privilege; though he, today
    consorteth with the people, who surrounds
    them with a border. Both the Gualterotti
    and Importuni were already there;
    and now their Borgo would more quiet be,
    if from new neighbors it were fasting still.
    The family, which to your tears gave birth,
    through the just scorn which brought about your death,
    and put an end to your once happy life,
    was honored, in itself and in its kin.
    How, Buondelmonte, ill-advised thou wast
    to flee their marriage, counselled by another!
    Many would happy be, who now are sad,
    if God had to the Ema granted thee,
    when coming for the first time into town;
    but Florence to that mutilated stone
    which guards the bridge, must needs a sacrifice
    afford, when in her final hour of peace.

    With these same families, and others with them
    Florence I saw in such a state of rest,
    that no occasion had she then for tears;
    with these same families I saw her then
    so glorious and so righteous, that the Lily
    was never set upon a staff reversed,
    nor made, because of her divisions, red.”

    to sons makes fathers chary, to be sure
    of that which he had heard against himself;
    even such was I, and such was felt to be
    by Beatrice, and by the holy lamp,
    who first on my account had changed his place.

    Wherefore my Lady said to me: “Express
    thy wish’s ardor, so that it may issue
    clearly impressed by its internal stamp;
    not that our knowledge may the greater grow
    by words of thine, but that thou mayst get used
    to tell thy thirst, that we may pour thee drink!”

    “O my dear root, that so dost lift thyself,
    that, as terrestrial minds perceive that no
    triangle holds two angles which are both
    obtuse; thou, likewise, gazing at the Point
    to which all things are present, dost perceive
    contingent things, ere in themselves they are;
    while I by Virgil was accompanied,
    upward around the Mount which healeth souls,
    and downward through the region of the dead,

    grave words were told me of my future life;
    although, indeed, I feel myself foursquare
    against the blows of fortune; my desire
    would hence contented be, were I to hear
    what kind of fortune is approaching me,
    for slower comes an arrow when foreseen.”

    Thus to that light I spoke, which had before
    addressed me; and, as Beatrice had willed,
    so was my wish confessed. Not in vague terms,
    in which the foolish folk of old were wont
    to get entangled, ere the Lamb of God,
    who taketh sins away, was put to death,
    but with clear words and unambiguous speech,
    that father’s love replied, which by its smile
    was both concealed and rendered manifest:

    “Contingence, which outside your matter’s volume
    doth not extend, is in the Eternal Vision
    wholly depicted; yet it taketh not
    necessity therefrom, save as a ship,
    while down a current moving, doth from eyes
    which mirror it.
    Therefrom, as from an organ
    sweet harmony attains one’s ears, the time
    which is for thee preparing strikes my sight.

    As through his false and cruel step-mother
    Hippolytus left Athens, so must thou
    leave Florence. This is willed already, this

    is sought, and soon will be achieved by him
    who meditates it there where every day
    Christ is both bought and sold. As usually,
    the blame will be imputed to the wronged
    in public outcry; but revenge for it
    will witness to the truth dispensing it.
    Thou shalt abandon all that thou hast loved
    with greatest tenderness; and of its shafts
    this is the one which exile’s bow shoots first.
    Thou shalt find out how salt another’s bread
    is wont to taste, and what a painful thing
    is going up and down another’s stairs.
    But what will bow thy shoulders most will be
    the bad and foolish company, with whom
    thou ’lt fall into this vale; for all ungrateful,
    mad and malevolent will it become
    against thee; but soon thereafter, it, not thou,
    will have its forehead red with blood. Its deeds
    will furnish proof of its bestiality;
    hence well-becoming will it be for thee
    to have made thyself a party by thyself.

    Thy earliest refuge and first lodging-place
    shall be the courtesy of that great Lombard,
    who on the Ladder bears the holy Bird;
    and who will have for thee such kind regard,
    that ’tween you two, in doing and in asking,
    that will be first, which is with others last.

    With him the man thou ’lt see, who was, when born,
    so stamped by this strong star, that notable
    will be his deeds. By reason of his youth,
    the nations are not yet aware of him,
    for only nine years have these wheels revolved
    around him; but, before the Gascon cheat
    the noble Henry, sparks of his character
    will manifest themselves by disregard
    for money or for toil. And so well known
    will his munificence hereafter be,
    that ev’n his enemies will not be able
    to still their tongues at it. On him rely,
    and on his favors; many will be changed
    because of him, the rich and those that beg
    exchanging states; and written on thy mind
    shalt thou bear hence, but shalt not tell it,” — here
    he told me things incredible to those
    who shall be present. Then he added: “Son,
    glosses are these on what was said to thee;
    behold the snares which lie concealed behind
    not many circlings of the sun. And yet
    I would not have thee envious toward thy neighbors,
    because thy life far longer will extend
    than will the punishment of their bad faith.”

    When by his silence that blest soul had showed
    that he was through with weaving in the woof
    of that same web which I had given him warped,

    then I began, like one who, doubting, longs
    for counsel from a man who both perceives,
    wills righteously and loves: “I clearly see,
    my father, how toward me a time spurs on,
    to deal me such a blow as heaviest is
    to him who gives least heed to it; ’t is, therefore, well
    that I should so with foresight arm myself,
    that if the place which is to me most dear
    be taken from me, I lose not the rest
    by these my verses. Downward through the world
    whose bitterness is endless, and around
    the Mount, from whose fair top my Lady’s eyes
    have lifted me, and afterward through Heaven
    from light to light, things have I heard which, if
    repeated, will for many have the taste
    of bitter herbs; and yet, if I ’m to truth
    a timid friend, I fear lest life I lose
    with those who shall of this age speak as ancient.”

    The light, wherein that treasure smiled, which there
    I found, sparkled at first, as in a sunbeam
    a golden mirror would; and then replied:
    “A conscience gloomy either with its own,
    or with another’s shame, will feel, indeed,
    the harshness of thy words; yet, none the less,
    all falsehood having been removed from it,
    cause thy whole vision to be manifest,
    and where the itch is let the scratching be!

    For if, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove
    offensive, it will after leave behind it,
    when once digested, vital nourishment.
    This cry of thine will do as doth the wind,
    which strikes the loftiest summits most; and this
    will no slight honor prove. Hence only souls
    well known to fame were shown thee in these Heavens,
    upon the Mount, and in the woeful Vale;
    because the mind of him who hears rests not,
    nor strengthens its belief by illustrations
    based upon what is hidden and unknown,
    or by an argument that is not clear.”

PARADISO XVIII

The Fifth Heaven. Mars. The Spirits of Heroes

The Sixth Heaven. Jupiter. The Happiness of Justice

    That blessèd mirror was enjoying now
    its thoughts alone, and I was tasting mine,
    tempering their sweetness with their bitterness;
    when that same Lady who was leading me
    to God, said: “Change thy thought; recall that near
    I am to Who unburdens every wrong.”

    I turned me at my Comfort’s loving voice;
    and in her holy eyes what kind of love
    I then beheld, I here refrain from saying;
    not only since mine own words I distrust,
    but since my mind can not return so far
    above itself, unless Another guide it.

    This only of that moment can I tell,
    that my affection, while I gazed at her,
    was freed from longing for all other things,
    as long as Joy Eternal, which directly shone
    on Beatrice, with its reflected aspect
    was from her lovely face contenting me.

    Conquering me with the splendor of a smile,
    she said: “Turn round and hark; for Paradise
    is not exclusively within my eyes.”

    As our affection here is seen at times
    upon our countenance, if such it be
    that our whole spirit is thereby absorbed;
    so, in the flaming of the blest effulgence
    to whom I turned, I recognized his wish
    to have a little further talk with me.

    “In this fifth threshold of the Tree,” it then
    began, “which from its summit draws its life,
    always bears fruit, and never loses leaves,
    are blessèd spirits, who, before they came
    to Heaven, enjoyed so great a fame below,
    that every Muse would be thereby enriched.
    Gaze, therefore, at the Cross’s arms; and he,
    whom I shall name, will there perform the act,
    which in a cloud its own swift fire performs.”

    I saw a splendor drawn along the Cross
    at Joshua’s name, the moment it was uttered,
    nor did I note the name before the deed.
    And at great Maccabaeus’ name, I saw
    another spirit whirling as he moved;
    and gladness was the whip that turned the top.
    Likewise, at Charlemagne’s and Roland’s names,
    my gaze intently followed two of them,
    as doth a falconer’s eye his flying bird.
    Then William afterward, and Renoart,
    Duke Godfrey next, and Robert Guiscard drew
    my sight along that Cross. And then,

    moving and mingling with the other lights,
    the soul which had addressed me, showed how great
    an artist ’mong Heaven’s choristers he was.

    Round to my right I turned me to behold
    in Beatrice my duty, signified
    by speech or act;
    and I beheld her eyes
    so joyous and so clear, that what she seemed
    surpassed her other and her latest wont.

    And as, because of feeling more delight
    in doing good, a man from day to day
    perceiveth that his virtue is increasing;
    ev’n so, on seeing that that miracle
    was fairer now, I noticed that the arc
    of my revolving with the heavens had grown.

    And as within a little space of time
    a lady turneth white, whene’er her face
    rids itself of the burden of its shame;
    such to mine eyes the change, when I had turned,
    through the white color of the temperate
    sixth star, which had received me in itself.

    I saw within that Jovial torch of light
    the sparkling of the love contained in it,
    shaping our language forth before mine eyes;
    and even as birds on rising from the shore,
    as if in gratulation at the food they’ve found,
    form groups, now round, and now of other shapes;

    thus holy creatures in those lights were singing,
    as here and there they flew, and with their forms
    made of themselves now D, now I, now L.
    Each singing to its note, they moved at first;
    then, on becoming one of these same letters,
    they stopped a little while, and silent kept.

    O thou divine Pegàsean Muse, that glorious
    dost make men’s genius, and dost render it
    long-lived, as it through thee doth towns and realms,
    so shed thy light on me, that I may here
    describe their figures ev’n as I perceived them;
    in these brief verses let thy power appear!

    They then displayed themselves in consonants
    and vowels five times seven; and as their parts
    seemed to be said to me, I noted them.

    Diligite Justitiam were first verb
    and noun of all that was depicted there;
    Qui Judicatis Terram were the last.

    Then in the fifth word’s M they so remained
    arranged, that Jupiter seemed silver there
    pricked out with gold.
    And other lights I saw
    descend upon the summit of the M,
    and rest there, singing, I believe, the Good
    which draws them to Itself. Then, as when logs
    are struck while burning, endless sparks fly up,
    whence fools are wont to draw their auguries;

    more than a thousand lights appeared to rise,
    and upward move, some much, and some a little,
    even as the Sun, which setteth them on fire,
    allotted them; and when they quiet were,
    each in its place, an Eagle’s head and neck
    I saw portrayed by that outstanding fire.

    He who paints there hath none to be His guide,
    but is His own guide; and from Him derives
    the instinct which is formative in nests.

    The other blest ones, who at first appeared
    content to form a Lily on the M,
    went slowly on to shape the Eagle’s form.

    O gentle star, what and how many gems
    proved to me that our justice here results
    from that heaven’s influence which is gemmed by thee!
    I therefore pray the Mind, wherein thy motion
    and virtue start, that It may so regard
    the source, whence comes the smoke which spoils thy rays,
    that It may now a second time be wroth
    with sale and purchase in that temple’s court,
    whose walls were built with blood and martyrdom.

    O soldiers of the heaven I contemplate,
    pray ye for those that are on earth, all gone
    astray behind the bad example there!
    War was once carried on with swords; but now
    by taking here and there that bread away,
    the Pitying Father keepeth locked from none.

    But thou, that writest but to cancel, think
    that Peter and Paul, who for that vineyard died,
    which thou art laying waste, are still alive!
    Well mayst thou say: “So set is my desire
    on him, whose will it was to live alone,
    and for a dance was led to martyrdom,
    that I know neither Fisherman nor Paul.”

PARADISO XIX

The Sixth Heaven. Jupiter. The Happiness of Justice

Inscrutability of God’s Justice. Unjust Princes

    Before me now, with wings outspread, appeared
    the lovely image, which in sweet fruition
    those joyous interwoven spirits made.
    Each one of them a little ruby seemed,
    wherein a ray of sunlight burned so brightly,
    that it was mirrored back into mine eyes.

    And what I now must needs relate, no voice
    hath e’er reported, nor hath ink inscribed,
    nor hath imagination ever grasped;
    for I both saw and heard the beak converse,
    and utter in its voice both ‘I’ and ‘My,’
    when in its meaning it was ‘We’ and ‘Our.’

    And it began: “Because of being just
    and merciful, I’m to a glory raised
    up here, which doth not let itself be won
    by mere desire; and such a fame I left
    on earth, that evil people there commend it,
    but fail to follow its recorded works.”

    As out of many embers one sole heat
    makes itself felt, so from that image, formed
    by many loves, a single voice came forth.

    Hence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers
    of joy eternal, who let all your odors
    seem only one to me, by breathing, break
    the painful fast,
    which long hath given me hunger,
    for I on earth have found no food for it.
    Well do I know that, even if in Heaven
    Justice Divine makes of another realm
    its looking-glass, yours apprehends it not
    through any veil. Ye know with what attention
    I gird myself to listen; and ye know
    the doubt which is so old a fast for me.”

    And as a falcon, from his hood set free,
    tosses his head, and, flapping his proud wings,
    displays his eagerness, and plumes himself;
    such I beheld the symbol which is weaved
    by praises of the Grace Divine, become
    with songs, which who up there rejoices knows.

    It then began: “He who His compass turned
    around the world’s last verge, and in it parted
    its many hidden things from those revealed,
    was not so able to impress His Virtue
    on all the world, that His conceived ideal
    should not remain in infinite excess.
    And this assures one that the first proud being
    who greater was than all created spirits,
    through not awaiting light, untimely fell;

    it hence results that every lesser nature
    is but a scant recipient for the Good
    which hath no end, and measures Self by Self.
    Your vision, therefore, which must needs be one
    of that Mind’s rays,
    wherewith all things are filled,
    of its own nature cannot be so strong,
    that it should not perceive its Source as being
    far greater than is all that it can see.
    The vision, therefore, which your world receives,
    into Eternal Justice penetrates
    as doth an eye into the sea; because,
    though it perceive its bottom near the shore,
    when on the deep it sees it not; yet there
    it is, but its great depth conceals it.
    That is not light, which comes not from the Sky
    which never clouds itself; but rather darkness,
    a shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.

    Sufficiently disclosed to thee is now
    the hiding-place which once concealed from thee
    the Living Justice, which so frequently
    it was thy wont to question; for thou saidst:
    ‘A man is born upon the Indus’ banks,
    with no one there to speak of Christ, or read,
    or write; and all his actions and desires
    are good, as far as human reason sees,
    and without sin in either life or speech;

    then, unbaptized and without faith, he dies.
    Wherein consists the Justice which condemns him?
    Where is his fault, if he believeth not?’

    Now who art thou, that as a judge would’st sit
    to judge of things a thousand miles away
    with the short vision of a human span?
    Surely for him who subtly strives with me,
    were not the Scriptures ruling over you,
    wondrous occasions would there be for doubt.
    O earthly creatures! O uncultured minds!

    The Primal Will, which of Itself is Good,
    ne’er from Itself, the Highest Goodness, moved.
    That much is just, which is therewith accordant;
    no good created draws It to itself,
    but It by radiating causes it.”

    As o’er her nest a stork moves circling round,
    after the feeding of her little ones,
    and as the one that ’s fed looks up at her;
    such did the blessèd shape become, which moved
    its pinions, by so many counsels urged,
    and, likewise, so did I lift up my brows.

    Wheeling around, it sang and said: “As now
    my notes to thee, that understand’st them not,
    such to you mortals is Eternal Justice.”

    When those bright flamings of the Holy Spirit
    had come to rest, still in the shape which caused
    the Romans to be honored by the world,

    “None to this Kingdom” it began again,
    “ever ascended without faith in Christ,
    either before, or after He was nailed
    upon the tree. But many, lo! shout ‘Christ!’
    who at the Judgment shall be far less near Him,
    than will be such an one who knows not Christ;
    Christians like these the Ethiop will condemn,
    when parted shall the two assemblies be,
    one rich eternally, the other poor.

    What will the Persians to your rulers say,
    when lying open they shall see the Book,
    wherein all their dispraises are inscribed?

    There will be seen, among the deeds of Albert,
    that which ere long will move the pen, because
    thereby Prague’s kingdom will become a waste.
    There will be seen the woe, which on the Seine
    he who shall perish by a boar skin’s blow,
    bringeth about by falsifying coin.
    There will be seen the pride and thirsty greed,
    which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad,
    that neither can remain within his bounds.
    One will see there the easy life and lust
    of him of Spain, and of Bohemia, too,
    who neither of them knew, nor cared for, valor.
    One will see there, marked with a single I,
    the virtues of Jerusalem’s lame king,
    whereas an M will mark the contrary.


    One will see there the greed and cowardice
    of him who ruleth o’er the isle of fire,
    where once Anchises ended his long life.
    And, to explain his insignificance,
    his record will consist of shortened words,
    which in a little space will notice much.
    And there to each and all will be revealed
    the foul deeds of his uncle and his brother,
    who two crowns and a noble line disgraced.
    And he of Portugal, and he of Norway,
    will there be known, as also Rascia’s prince,
    who in an ill hour saw Venetia’s coin.
    O happy Hungary, if she no more
    shall let herself be wronged! Happy Navarre,
    if with her girding hills she arm herself!
    And both these should believe that Nicosìa
    and Famagosta, as a proof of this,
    are wailing now, and raging at their beast,
    because he does not differ from the rest.”

PARADISO XX

The Sixth Heaven. Jupiter. The Happiness of Justice

Just Princes. Faith and Salvation. Predestination

    When he who sheddeth light on all the world
    so far below our hemisphere descends,
    that daylight fades away on every side,
    the sky, once lighted up by him alone,
    is quickly rendered visible again
    by many lights, whereof one only shines;
    and I this happening in the sky recalled,
    when silent in the blessèd beak became
    the Standard of the world and of its leaders;
    for, brighter far,
    those living lights commenced
    songs which have fled and fallen from my mind.

    O thou sweet Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,
    how ardent in those flutes didst thou appear,
    whose only breath was that of holy thoughts!

    After those precious and pellucid jewels
    wherewith I saw the sixth great light engemmed,
    had brought to silence their angelic chimes,
    I seemed to hear the murmur of a brook,
    which, flowing limpid down from rock to rock,
    reveals the abundance of its mountain-springs.

    And as a sound takes from a cittern’s neck
    its form, even as the air that enters it
    doth from the vent-hole of a shepherd’s pipe,
    so, all delay of waiting laid aside,
    that murmur of the Eagle mounted up
    along its neck, as if it hollow were.
    A voice it there became, and through its beak
    it issued forth in words, such as the heart
    whereon I wrote them down, was longing for.

    “That part of me which sees, and braves the sun,
    in mortal eagles,” it began again,
    “must now be looked upon attentively,
    for of the fires wherewith I shape me, those
    wherewith the eye is sparkling in my head,
    the highest are of all their ordered grades.

    He that as pupil in the middle shines,
    was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,
    who bore the Ark about from town to town;
    he now knows how deserving was his song,
    so far as it resulted from his will,
    by the reward proportioned to its merit.

    Of five that make a circle for my brow,
    the spirit nearest to my beak was he,
    who comforted the widow for her son;
    he now knows by his personal experience
    of this sweet life and of its opposite,
    how dear it costs one not to follow Christ.

    In the circumference of which I speak,
    he that comes next upon the rising arc,
    delayed his death by genuine repentance;
    he now knows that Eternal Justice brooks
    no change, whenever worthy prayers below
    to-morrow’s make of that which was today’s.

    The one who follows, with the laws and me,
    with good intentions which produced bad fruits,
    made himself Greek by ceding to the Shepherd;
    he now knows that the ill, from his good deed
    derived, is not a cause of harm to him,
    although thereby the world may be destroyed.

    He whom thou seest in the downward arc,
    the William was, for whom that country mourns,
    which weeps because its Charles and Frederick live;
    he now knows how Heaven loves a righteous king,
    and by his splendor’s glow
    reveals it still.

    Who in the erring world below would think
    that Rìpheus the Trojan was the fifth
    among the holy lights which form this curve?
    He now knows many of the things the world
    is impotent to see in Grace Divine,
    although his sight discerneth not its depths.

    Like a young lark which, as it soars through space,
    first sings, and then is silent, satisfied
    with the last sweetness which contented her;

    such seemed to me the image of the seal
    of that Eternal Pleasure, by whose will
    each thing becometh what it is. And though,
    with reference to my doubt, up there I was,
    as glass is to the color which it clothes,
    it could not bear to bide its time in silence;
    but by the very force of its own weight
    urged from my mouth the words, “What things are these?”
    whereat I saw a glorious feast of sparkling.

    Thereafter, with its eye the more enkindled,
    the blessèd Sign, in order not to keep me
    in wondering suspense, replied to me:
    “I see that thou believest all these things,
    because I say them, but dost not see how;
    and therefore, though believed in, they are hidden.
    Thou dost as one who fully knows a thing
    by name, but cannot see just what it is,
    unless another make it manifest.

    Regnum Coelorum suffers violence
    from burning love, and from a living hope,
    which vanquishes the Will Divine; though not
    as man o’ercometh man, but conquers it
    because it willeth to be overcome;
    and so, though vanquished, by its goodness wins.

    The first life in the eyebrow, and the fifth
    cause thee to be amazed, because therewith
    thou see’st the region of the Angels painted.

    They did not issue Gentiles from their bodies,
    as thou dost think, but Christians, with firm faith,
    one in the Feet that were to suffer, one,
    in those that had. For one, to claim his bones,
    came back from Hell, where no one ever wills
    the good again; and this was the reward
    of living hope; of living hope which put
    its trust in prayers addressed to God to raise him,
    that thus his will might have a chance to act.

    The glorious soul I speak of, when the flesh
    had been regained, wherein he stayed not long,
    believed in Him, who had the power to help him;
    and through belief so warmed to genuine love,
    that he was worthy at his second death
    to come to this festivity. The other,
    through grace from so profound a spring distilled,
    that never hath the eye of any creature
    reached its first wave, set all his love below
    on righteousness; hence God, from grace to grace,
    to our redemption which is still to be,
    opened his eyes; he hence believed in it,
    and afterward endured no more the stench
    of Paganism; and for it he rebuked
    those who perverted were. And those three Ladies
    thou sawest at the right wheel of the Car,
    in lieu of baptism, were as sponsors for him
    more than a thousand years ere baptism was.

    O thou Predestination, how remote
    are thy foundations from the sight of those
    who do not see the First Cause as a whole!

    And ye, O mortals, keep yourselves in check,
    when judging men; for we, who God behold,
    know not as yet all those that are elect;
    and pleasant is such ignorance to us,
    because our good is in this good refined,
    that what is willed by God, we also will.”

    Thus, then, by that divinely pictured image,
    to make the shortness of my vision clear,
    a pleasant medicine was granted me.

    And as a skillful cithern player makes
    the string’s vibrations follow a good singer,
    whereby the song acquires more power to please;
    even so, while it was speaking, I recall
    that both those blessèd lights I then beheld,
    as when, in winking, eyes concordant are,
    moving their flamelets to the Eagle’s words.

    And now mine eyes upon my Lady’s face
    were fixed again, and therewithal my mind,
    which from all other objects had withdrawn.
    Nor was she smiling then; but: “Should I smile,”
    she said, addressing me, “like Sèmelë
    wouldst thou become, when she to ashes turned;
    because my beauty, which along the stairs
    of this eternal palace brighter burns,
    as thou hast seen, the higher we ascend,
    is so resplendent that thy mortal strength
    at its effulgence, were it not restrained,
    would be as is a bough which lightning rends.

    Up to the seventh splendor we are raised,
    which now beneath the burning Lion’s breast
    is raying downward mingled with his strength.
    Intently fix thy mind behind thine eyes,
    and cause them to be mirrors of the figure
    which in this mirror will appear to thee.”

    He that should know what, in the blessèd face,
    the nature of my vision’s pasture was,
    when I transferred me to another care,

    would know, since one
    was outweighed by the other,
    how gladly I obeyed my heavenly Guide.

    Within the crystal which, as round the world
    it whirls, bears its illustrious leader’s name,
    under whose rule all wickedness lay dead,
    colored like gold whereon a sun-beam shone,
    a Ladder I beheld, which so high up
    ascended, that my eye pursued it not.

    I saw, moreover, coming down its steps
    so many glowing splendors, that I thought
    that every star seen shining in the sky
    had been poured out of it. And even as daws,
    as is their natural wont, when day begins,
    together move to warm their chilly plumes;
    and then without returning some fly off,
    and some go back to whence they started first,
    while others, whirling in a circle, stay;
    such was, it seemed to me, the fashion here
    within the sparkling throng which came together,
    whene’er they met upon a certain round;
    and that which nearest to me there remained,
    became so bright, that in my thoughts I said:
    “I clearly see the love thou showest me.”

    But she, whence I await the how and when
    of silence and of speech, keeps still; hence I,
    against my will, do well by asking naught.

    She, thereupon, who in the sight of Him
    who seeth everything, my silence saw,
    said unto me: “Appease thy warm desire!”

    And I began: “My merit doth not make me
    worthy of thy reply; but, for the sake
    of her who granteth me the right to ask,
    make known to me, blest life that art concealed
    in thine own joy, the cause which draweth thee
    so closely to my side; and tell me why
    that gentle symphony of Paradise
    is silent in this wheel, which down below
    sounds so devoutly through the other spheres.”

    “Thy hearing is as mortal as thy sight;”
    it answered me; “there is no singing here
    because of that which hinders Beatrice
    from smiling. Down the holy Ladder’s steps
    have I so far descended, but to give thee
    a welcome with my words and with the light
    which mantles me; nor hath a greater love
    caused me to be more ready; for as much
    or more love burns up yonder, as those flames
    reveal to thee; but that great charity
    which makes us ready servants of the Counsel
    which rules the world, allots here, as thou seest.”

    “I well perceive, O holy lamp,” said I,
    “hòw that free love is in this court enough
    for following the Eternal Providence;

    but this is what seems hard for me to see,
    why thou alone among thy consorts here
    predestinated wert for just this task.”

    No sooner had I come to my last word,
    than, like a rapid millstone whirling round,
    the light had of its middle made its center;
    and then the love within it answered me:

    “Piercing the light wherein I’m here embosomed,
    a ray of light divine upon me falls,
    whose virtue, as it mingles with my sight,
    so lifts me o’er myself, that I behold
    that Highest Essence whence it emanates.
    Hence comes the joy with which I’m flaming now,
    for with my sight, as far as it is clear,
    I equalize the clearness of my flame.

    And yet the most enlightened soul in Heaven,
    the Seraph who hath eyes most fixed on God,
    would not avail to satisfy thy question;
    for what thou askest plumbeth so the depths
    of God’s eternal statute, that from all
    created vision it is cut away.

    And to the mortal world, on thy return,
    carry this charge, that it presume no more
    to move its feet toward such a distant goal.
    The mind which shineth here, on earth is smoky;
    consider, hence, how it can do down there
    what, though assumed to Heaven, it cannot do.”

    So all-conclusive were his words to me,
    that, giving up the question, I confined me
    to asking humbly of him who he was.

    “’Tween Italy’s two seashores cliffs arise,
    not very far from thine own native place,
    so high, that thunders peal much lower down;
    and form a lofty ridge called Càtria,
    ’neath which a hermitage is consecrate,
    whose wont to worship only gives it up.”

    He thus began for me his third address,
    and then, continuing, said: “To serving God
    I there became so steadfastly devoted,
    that, feeding upon olive juice alone,
    I readily endured both heat and cold,
    and was with thoughts contemplative content.

    That cloister’s wont it was to yield these heavens
    abundant fruit; but it hath now become
    so empty, that its state must soon be known.
    In that place I was known as Peter Damian;
    and Sinning Peter in Our Lady’s House
    I was, upon the Adriatic shore.
    But little mortal life remained to me,
    when I was sought, and forced to take the hat,
    which always passes on from bad to worse.

    Lean and barefooted Cephas came, and then,
    the Holy Spirit’s mighty Vessel came,
    eating the food of any hostelry;

    our modern shepherds now on either side
    need help to prop them, help — they weigh so much! —
    to guide, and help to hold them up behind.
    They cover so their palfreys with their cloaks,
    that two beasts walk beneath a single hide.
    O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!”

    More flamelets at these words I saw descend
    from step to step, and whirl; and every whirl
    caused each of them to grow more beautiful;
    and round this flame they came, and having stopped,
    uttered so deep a cry, that none could here
    resemble it; nor did I understand
    its words; its thunder overcame me so.

PARADISO XXII

The Seventh Heaven. Saturn. St. Benedict

The Eighth or Starry Heaven. The Twins

    Oppressed with stupor, to my Guide I turned,
    as would a little child who always runs
    for help to where he most confides; and she,
    as doth a mother who at once assists
    her pale and breathless offspring with her voice,
    whose wont is to assure him, said to me:

    “Knowest thou not that thou art now in Heaven?
    and know’st thou not that all of Heaven is holy,
    and that of good zeal cometh all done here?
    To what extent the song, as well as I
    by smiling, would have changed thee, thou canst now
    imagine, since the cry has shocked thee so;
    in it, if thou hadst understood its prayers,
    already were that vengeance known to thee,
    which thou shalt see before thou die. Our sword
    up here cuts nor in haste nor tardily,
    save as to one it seems, who waits for it
    with either apprehension or desire.

    But turn thyself around toward others now;
    for many illustrious spirits shalt thou see,
    if, as I tell thee, thou direct thine eyes.

    Mine eyes I then directed as she pleased,
    and saw a hundred little spheres which, gathering,
    by mutual rays each other fairer made.
    Like one I was, who checks within himself
    the goad of his desire, and dares not ask,
    so great his fear lest he may ask too much.

    The largest and most lustrous of those pearls
    came forward thereupon, to sate my wish
    concerning it.
    Within it then I heard:
    “If thou, as I do, couldst behold the love
    which burns among us here, thy thoughts would be
    expressed; but lest, by waiting, thou delay
    thy lofty aim, I’ll answer now the thought
    which causes thee to so restrain thyself.

    That mountain on whose slope Casino stands,
    was once frequented on its top by folk,
    who both deluded were and ill-disposed.
    And he am I, who first up yonder bore
    the name of Him, who carried down to earth
    the truth which here exalteth us so much;
    and such abundant grace upon me shone,
    that I withdrew the neighboring villages
    from that vain worship which seduced the world.
    These other fires were all contemplatives,
    men who were kindled by the heat which brings
    the flowers and fruits of holiness to birth.

    Here is Macarius, Romuald is here,
    and here are those my brethren, who remained
    in cloisters, and who steadfast kept their hearts.”

    And I to him: “The affection shown by thee,
    in talking with me, and the kindliness
    I see and note in all your burning flames,
    have opened wide my trust, even as the sun
    dilates the rose, whene’er its petals ope
    as widely as they can. Because of this
    I pray thee, father; do thou, then, inform me
    if I am worthy to receive such grace,
    as to behold thee with thy face unveiled.”

    Then “Brother,” he replied, “thy great desire
    in the last sphere above shall be fulfilled,
    where all thine others are, and mine as well.
    Every desire is perfect there, mature
    and whole; in that sphere only is each part
    where it has always been; for it is not
    in space, nor turns on poles, and up to it
    our Ladder reaches; and because of this
    it steals itself away beyond thy ken.
    Jacob, the patriarch, beheld it stretch
    thus far its upper portion, when of old
    laden with Angels it appeared to him.
    But from the earth, to climb it, no one now
    removes his feet, and my monastic rule
    remains but as a means of wasting paper.

    Walls which of old an abbey used to be,
    have now become the dens of thieves, and cowls
    are sacks now, filled with naught but wretched meal.
    But heavy usury doth not rebel
    against God’s will, as much as doth the fruit
    which renders so insane the hearts of monks;
    for, whatsoe’er the Church may hold in trust,
    is all for those that ask it in God’s name,
    and not for relatives, or what is worse.
    So soft the flesh of mortals is, that good
    beginnings do not last as long below,
    as from an oak’s until its acorn’s birth.
    Peter began with neither gold nor silver,
    and I, with prayers and fasts began my convent,
    as Francis, with humility, did his.
    And if thou look at each of these beginnings,
    and then consider whither each hath run,
    thou ’lt see that what was white hath turned to brown.
    Jordan turned backward, and the water fleeing
    when God so willed, were much more wonderful
    to see, in fact, than succor would be here.”

    He thus addressed me; to his company
    thereat returning, they together closed;
    then, like a whirlwind, all were upward rapt.

    The gentle Lady up that Ladder’s rounds
    urged me behind them by a sign alone,
    her virtue so o’ercame my natural weight;

    nor here below, where one goes up and down
    by natural law, was motion e’er so swift,
    as to be equal to my pinions’ flight.

    So may I, Reader, once again return
    to that celestial triumph, for whose sake
    I oft bewail my sins and smite my breast;
    thou hadst not drawn away and put thy finger
    as quickly into fire, as I beheld
    the sign which follows Taurus, and was in it.

    O glorious stars, O light, that pregnant art
    with mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge
    all of my genius, whatsoe’er it be;
    with you was born, and in your midst was hiding
    he who is father of all mortal life,
    when first I breathed the Tuscan air; and then,
    when grace had been bestowed upon me here
    to enter that high wheel which turns you round,
    your region was the one allotted me.
    To you my sighing soul devoutly prays,
    that it may now acquire the power it needs
    for that hard task, which draws her to itself.”

    “To Ultimate Salvation thou art now
    so near,” in answer Beatrice began,
    “that clear should be thine eyes, and keen their sight.
    Therefore, ere further thou in-it thyself,
    look downward, and behold how great a world
    I have already set beneath thy feet;

    so that thy heart, as joyous as it can,
    may show itself to that triumphant throng
    which happy comes through this ethereal sphere.”

    Then with my vision I returned through one
    and all seven spheres, and this globe I beheld
    such that its mean appearance made me smile;
    hence that opinion I approve as best
    which deems it least; and just may he
    be called, who sets his thought on something else.

    Latona’s daughter I enkindled saw
    without the shadow which was once the cause
    of my believing her both rare and dense.
    The countenance, Hyperion, of thy son
    I here sustained; and saw how near to him
    both Maia and Diòne round him move.
    And after this, the temperance of Jove
    appeared to me, between his son and sire;
    and clear the reason for their change of place.
    All seven of them were thus revealed to me,
    how great they are, how swift, and far apart
    in their abodes. The little threshing-floor
    which maketh us so fierce, was as a whole
    revealed to me, from hills to river-mouths,
    while I was circling with the eternal Twins.

    Back to the lovely eyes I then turned mine.

PARADISO XXIII

The Eighth Heaven. The Fixed Stars. The Twins

Triumphant Spirits. The Son of God. The Mother of Christ

    Even as a bird, among the leaves she loves,
    settles upon the nest of her sweet brood
    throughout the night, which hides things from our eyes,
    and then — that she may see their longed for looks,
    and find the food wherewith to nourish them,
    in doing which she deems hard work a pleasure —
    comes forth betimes upon an outer branch,
    and gazing steadfastly with burning love,
    waits for the sun till break of dawn; so stood
    my Lady, toward that region turned intent,
    ’neath which the sun
    appears to show least haste;
    hence I, on seeing her absorbed in thought,
    became like one who, yearning with desire
    for other things, contents himself with hope.

    But little time elapsed between each ‘when,’
    I mean from when I waited, till the sky
    I saw grow more and more suffused with light.
    Then Beatrice exclaimed: “Behold the hosts
    of Christ’s victorious triumph, and all the fruit
    ingathered by the circling of these spheres!”

    To me her countenance seemed all on fire,
    and so replete with happiness her eyes,
    that I must pass without describing them.

    As, when in cloudless skies the moon is full,
    Trìvia among those nymphs eternal smiles,
    who deck with light the whole expanse of heaven;
    so I, above a thousand thousand lamps,
    beheld a Sun which kindled one and all,
    as our sun kindles all the stars on high;
    and through the living light the Shining Substance
    was so transparent, and so brightly shone
    upon my face, that I endured it not.

    O Beatrice, thou dear and gentle Guide!
    “That which o’erwhelms thee is a Power,” she said,
    “against which nothing can defend itself.
    This is the Wisdom, this the Virtue is,
    which opened wide the road ’tween Heaven and earth,
    which was in olden times so long desired.”

    As fire is liberated from a cloud,
    when so dilating that it finds no room,
    and falls, against its nature, to the earth;
    even so my mind, as it became enlarged
    among those viands, issued from itself;
    but what it then became, can not recall.

    “Open thine eyes, and see what now I am!
    Such things hast thou perceived, that thou art now
    equipped with power to look upon my smile.”

    I was like one who, when aroused from sleep,
    is of a dream aware which he forgets,
    and tries in vain to bring it back to mind,
    when I had heard a bidding which deserves
    such gratitude, that never from the book
    which holds past records will it be effaced.

    If now, to help me, all those tongues should speak,
    which Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
    most richly with the sweetest of their milk,
    the thousandth portion of the truth would not
    be reached, ev’n though they sang the holy smile,
    and how it lighted up the holy face;
    hence, painting Paradise,
    the sacred Poem
    must leap like one who finds his path cut off.
    But none, who to its weighty theme gave thought,
    and to the mortal shoulder bearing it,
    would blame it, should it tremble ’neath its load.
    No waters for a little boat are these,
    my daring plow goes cleaving on its way,
    nor for a pilot who would spare himself.

    “Why doth my countenance enamor thee
    so much, that to the garden beautiful
    thou turnest not, which blooms beneath Christ’s rays?
    Here is the Rose, in which the Word Divine
    became incarnate; here the Lilies are,
    whose scent led men to take the righteous path.”

    Thus Beatrice; and I, who for her counsels
    was wholly ready, gave myself again
    to fight the battle of the feeble brows.

    As once my overshadowed eyes beheld
    a field of flowers in a ray of sunlight
    which through a riven cloud was shining clear;
    thus many a throng of splendors saw I now,
    illumined from on high by burning rays,
    but not the source of their refulgent light.

    O Kindly Virtue, who dost thus impress them,
    thou didst uplift thyself, to give mine eyes,
    which were not strong yet, greater room to see.

    The name of that fair Flower which I invoke
    each morn and evening, too, forced all my mind
    to turn its gaze upon the greatest fire;
    but when in both mine eyes the magnitude
    and splendor of that living Star was painted,
    which vanquishes up there, as once down here;
    a torch, formed ring-wise like a crown, descended
    from midmost heaven, and girdling her about,
    around her whirled. Whatever melody
    sounds sweetest here on earth, and to itself
    most strongly draws the soul, would seem a peal
    of thunder breaking from a cloud,
    if measured by the music of the lyre,
    with which that lovely Sapphire crowned itself,
    whereby ensapphired glows the brightest heaven.

    “Angelic Love am I, and circle round
    the exalted gladness breathing from the womb
    which was the hostelry of our Desire;
    and I shall whirl around it, Lady of Heaven,
    until thy Son thou follow, and diviner
    render the loftiest sphere by entering it.”

    The circling melody thus closed itself
    as with a seal; and all the other lights
    made Mary’s name resound. The royal robe
    of all the convolutions of the world,
    which burneth most,
    and by the breath and ways
    of God is quickened with the greatest life,
    had its internal shore so far above us,
    that, where I was, its semblance was not yet
    revealed to me; mine eyes, hence, could not follow
    the Flame which, crowned,
    behind its Offspring rose.

    And as a child, who, having had its milk,
    stretches its little arms up toward its mother,
    urged by the love which outwardly flames forth;
    thus each of those white spirits with its flame
    stretched up in such a way, that its deep love
    for Mary was made manifest to me.
    Thereafter they remained there in my presence,
    singing ‘O Queen of Heaven’ so tenderly
    that its delight hath never left me since.

    Oh, how abundant is the store heaped up
    in those most wealthy coffers, which were once
    good husbandmen for sowing seed below!
    Here, living on it, they enjoy the treasure,
    which, weeping in their exile, they acquired
    in Babylon, where gold was left untouched.
    Here triumphs, subject to the Exalted Son
    of God and Mary, in His victory,
    together with the councils old and new,
    he who of such great glory holds the Keys.

PARADISO XXIV

The Eighth or Starry Heaven. The Twins

St. Peter examines Dante on Faith

    “O Fellowship elected to the banquet
    of that Blest Lamb, who feedeth you so well,
    that ever sated is your appetite;
    since, by the grace of God, this man enjoys
    a foretaste of what falleth from your table,
    or ever death have set his time for him,
    heed his immense desire, and on him shed
    a little of your dew! Ye from the Source
    forever drink, whence cometh what he thinks.”

    Thus Beatrice; thereat those happy spirits
    arranged themselves in spheres on steady poles,
    emitting brilliant flames, as comets do.
    And ev’n as wheels within the works of clocks
    so turn, for one who heeds them, that the first
    seems quiet, while the last appears to fly;
    even so, since at a different speed they whirled,
    those carol-dances, whether swift or slow,
    permitted me to estimate their wealth.

    From that one which I deemed of greatest beauty,
    I saw a fire so happy issue forth,
    that none it left of greater brightness there;

    then around Beatrice it turned three times
    with so divine a song, that even my fancy
    repeats it not for me; and so my pen
    takes a leap forward, and I write it not;
    for our imagination, much more speech,
    too bright a color is to paint such folds.

    “O holy sister mine, who so devoutly
    dost pray to us, thou, by thine ardent love,
    withdrawest me from yonder lovely sphere.”
    When once at rest again, that blessèd fire
    turned toward my Lady with his voice, which spoke
    as I have said. And she replied to him:

    “O thou eternal life of that great man,
    to whom of this great joy our Lord bequeathed
    the Keys which He brought down; test thou this man
    as pleases thee, on questions light and grave
    pertaining to the Faith, which formerly
    enabled thee to walk upon the sea.
    If well he love, well hope, and well believe,
    is not concealed from thee, because thy sight
    is thither turned where all is seen depicted;
    but since this Realm hath through the true Faith won
    its citizens, ’t is well that, to its glory,
    it should befall him now to speak of it.”

    Even as a bachelor equips himself
    — nor speaks, until the master states the question —
    to furnish proofs, but not decide the same;

    so I, while she was speaking, armed myself,
    with every proof, that I might ready be
    for such a questioner, and such confession.

    “Speak now, good Christian, and declare thyself;
    What, then, is Faith?” Thereat I raised my brow
    toward the bright light from which these words were breathed;
    and then I turned around toward Beatrice,
    and she by rapid signals bade me pour
    the water forth from my internal fount.

    “The Grace which grants that I confess myself
    before the first Centurion,” I began,
    “cause my conceptions to be well expressed.”
    And I continued: “As the truthful pen
    of thy dear brother, Father, who with thee
    set Rome upon the right way, wrote of it,
    Faith is the substance of the hoped for things,
    and the evidence of those that are not seen;
    this seems to me its essence.” Then I heard:

    “Thou thinkest right, if well thou understand
    why with the substances he placed it first,
    and with the evidences afterward.”

    Thereat I answered: “Those deep truths which here
    are freely making themselves known to me,
    from eyes down yonder are so far concealed,
    that their existence lies in Faith alone,
    and thereupon the lofty Hope is based;
    it, therefore, takes the nature of a substance;

    and from this Faith one needs must syllogize
    without the help of any other sight; it, therefore,
    assumes the nature of an evidence.”

    And then I heard: “If thus were understood
    all that for doctrine is acquired below,
    there ’d be no room there for the sophist’s mind.”

    These words were breathed from that enkindled love,
    which added then: “Already have this coin’s
    alloy and weight been very well examined;
    but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse.”

    I, therefore: “Yes, so shining and so round,
    that nothing in its coinage makes me doubt.”

    Then issued from the deep light shining there:
    “Whence did this precious jewel come to thee,
    whereon all virtues else are based?” And I:

    “The abundant showers of the Holy Spirit,
    outpoured upon the parchments old and new,
    a syllogism have formed,
    which prove it true
    so clearly to me, that, all other proofs
    seem inconclusive when compared with it.

    “The Ancient Premise and the New,” I then
    heard asked, “which so conclusive are to thee,
    why dost thou take them for the word of God?”

    And I: “The proof which showeth me the truth,
    are those great works which followed, works for which
    Nature ne’er heated iron, nor anvil smote.”

    Then I was answered: “Say what makes thee sure
    that those works e’er occurred? The very thing
    which calls for proof, none other, tells thee so.”

    “If to Christianity the world was turned,”
    I said, “unhelped by miracles, then this
    is such, that not a hundredth are the rest;
    for thou didst poor and fasting go afield,
    to sow the goodly plant, which was of old
    a vine, and now has turned into a thorn.”

    This ending thus, the high and holy Court
    resounded through the spheres a “God we praise!”
    sung to the melody they sing up there.

    That Baron then, who thus from branch to branch
    had tested me, and now had led me on,
    until the final leaves were drawing near,
    began again: “The Grace which with thy mind
    holds loving converse, hitherto hath oped
    thy mouth as it should be; hence I approve
    of that which it hath uttered; but it now
    behooves thee say what thou believest in,
    and whence it has been offered to thy faith.”

    “O holy father, spirit that dost now
    behold what thou didst so believe, that thou
    didst outrun toward the tomb far younger feet,”
    I thus began, “thou ’dst have me now reveal
    the essential part of my sincere belief,
    and thou dost also ask the cause of it.

    And I reply: In One God I believe,
    Sole and Eternal, who, Himself unmoved,
    moves all the heavens with Love and with Desire;
    and I, for so believing, have not only
    proofs physical and metaphysical,
    but that truth also yieldeth me its proof,
    which hence rains down through Moses, psalms and prophets,
    and through the Gospel, and through you, who wrote
    after the Flaming Spirit made you shepherds.

    And I believe in three Eternal Persons,
    and these to be one Essence, so both one
    and trine, that they can be conjoined by are and is.

    Of the divine profound estate whereto
    I now refer, the teaching of the Gospel
    sets many times the seal upon my mind.
    This is the fountain-head, and this the spark,
    which after spreads into a living flame,
    and in me glows, as stars do in the sky.”

    As when a lord, hearing what pleases him,
    rejoices in the news his servant brings,
    and takes him to his arms, when he is silent;
    so, giving me his blessing as he sang,
    that Apostolic light, at whose command
    I spoke, when I had ceased, thrice girdled me;
    so greatly had I pleased him by my words.

Triumphant Spirits. St. James examines Dante on Hope

    If e’er it happen that the Sacred Poem,
    to which both Heaven and earth have so set hand,
    that it hath made me lean for many years,
    o’ercome the fierceness which against me bars
    the lovely fold, where as a lamb I slept,
    though hostile to the wolves that give it war;
    then, with another voice and other fleece
    a Poet I’ll return, and at the font
    of mine own baptism take the laurel crown;
    for there I entered first into the Faith,
    which makes souls known to God, and Peter later,
    because of my belief, thus wreathed my brow.

    Then toward us, after this, there moved a light
    out of the sphere, from which the first-fruit issued,
    which of his vicars Christ once left behind;
    and, full of joy, my Lady said to me:
    “Look, look! Behold the Baron, for whose sake
    men go to see Galicia down on earth!”

    As, when a dove alighteth near its mate,
    each, by its circling and its cooing, shows
    the other its affection; thus I saw

    one great and glorious Prince the other greet,
    and praise the food
    which sateth them up there.
    But when their mutual gratulations ceased,
    before me each in silence stopped, and flamed
    so brightly, that my face was forced to bow.

    Then, smiling, Beatrice: “Illustrious life,
    by whom the generous liberality
    of our basilica was once described,
    let Hope resound upon these heavenly heights;
    thou know’st that thou didst stand for it, as oft
    as Jesus showed most brightness to the three.”

    “Lift up thy head, and reassure thyself;
    for all that cometh from the mortal world
    up hither, must be ripened in our rays.”

    This comfort reached me from the second fire;
    hence to the hills I raised mine eyes, which erst
    had bowed them down by their excessive weight.

    “Since, of His Graciousness, our Emperor wills
    that thou, before thy death, shouldst face His Counts
    in His most secret hall; that, having seen
    the truth in this our court, thou mayst confirm,
    both in thyself and other souls, the Hope,
    which rightfully enamors men on earth;
    say what it is, and how therewith thy mind
    is blossoming, and whence it came to thee.”
    Thus, further, did the second light proceed.

    And that kind soul who to so high a flight
    had led the feathers of my wings, forestalled
    my answer thus:

    “No child of greater hope
    hath the Church Militant, as in the Sun
    is written, which irràdiates all our band,
    it, therefore, hath been granted him to come
    from Egypt to Jerusalem, and see,
    or e’er the period of his warfare end.
    Thine other two requests, made not for knowledge,
    but so that he may carry back with him
    to what extent this virtue pleases thee,
    I leave to him, for they will not be hard
    for him, nor matter for self-praise; to these
    let him reply, and may God’s Grace assist him.”

    Even as in that wherein he expert is,
    a pupil readily and willingly
    answers his teacher, that his worth be shown;
    “Hope is” I said, “a steadfast expectation
    of future glory, which by Grace divine
    and by preceding merit is produced.
    This light from many stars comes down to me;
    but he into my heart instilled it first,
    who was the Greatest Leader’s greatest bard.
    For “‘Let them hope in Thee, that know Thy Name!’
    the latter in his theody declares,
    and, if he have my faith, who knows it not?

    Then, thou with his instilling, didst so greatly
    instill that hope in me with thine epistle,
    that, filled with it, I pour your rain on others.”

    While I was speaking, in the living bosom
    of that great fire, a bright effulgence quivered
    quickly and often, like a lightning-flash;
    and then it breathed: “The love wherewith I still
    warm to the virtue which once followed me,
    till with the palm I issued from the field,
    would have me give my breath to thee again,
    that dost therein delight; and I am pleased
    to have thee say what promise Hope affords thee.”

    And I: “The Scriptures, both the new and old
    the goal establish of the souls whom God
    hath made His friends; this points it out to me.
    Isaiah says that each in his own land
    will in a double garment be arrayed;
    and his own land is this sweet life of ours;
    and, in a more explicit way, thy brother
    makes this same revelation manifest
    to us, where of the snow white robes the treats.”

    After these words had ended, first was heard
    above us, “Let them hope in Thee,” whereto
    all of the carols made reply; and then
    a light became so brilliant in their midst,
    that, if the Crab had such a crystal star,
    winter would have a month of one sole day.

    And as a happy maiden, rising, goes,
    in honor of the bride, to join the dance,
    and not for any failing on her part;
    even so I saw the splendor, brighter grown,
    approach the two, who in a wheel were turning,
    as it behooved the ardor of their love.
    Into the song and music then it entered;
    and on the three my Lady kept her gaze,
    silent and motionless as would a bride.

    “This is the one who on His breast reclined,
    who is our Pelican, and from the Cross
    selected was, to hold the filial office.”
    Even thus my Lady spoke;
    but no more after did her words withdraw
    her eyes from fixed attention, than before.

    Even as is he, who gazes at the sun,
    and tries to see it partially eclipsed,
    and who, because of seing, groweth blind;
    such I became before that latest fire,
    till this was said: “Why dost thou blind thyself,
    to see a thing which hath no being here?
    Earth is my body on the earth, and there
    will with the others stay, until our number
    shall with the eternal purpose correspond.
    With both their garments in the blessèd cloister
    are those two Lights alone, which hither rose;
    and this shalt thou take back unto your world.”

    Stilled was the flaming circle at these words,
    and with them that sweet mixture which was formed
    out of the music of the threefold breath,
    as, from fatigue or danger to escape,
    oars, which had stroked the water just before,
    are at a whistle’s sound all brought to rest.

    Ah, how disturbed in mind I then became,
    when I turned round to look at Beatrice,
    because I could not see her now, though close
    to her I was, and in the happy world!

PARADISO XXVI

St. John examines Dante on Love. Adam

    While I was frightened by my loss of vision,
    from the refulgent flaming which had quenched it,
    a breath, which caused me to give heed, came forth,
    and said: “Till thou regain the sense of sight
    which thou hast spent by gazing up at me,
    ’t is well that thou make up for it by speech.
    Therefore begin to speak; and say toward what
    thy soul aspires, and also bear in mind
    that sight in thee is lost, but not destroyed;
    because the Lady who is leading thee
    through this divine expanse, hath in her look
    the power possessed by Ananias’ hand.”

    “At her own pleasure, soon or late,” I said,
    let the cure reach the eyes which portals were,
    when with that fire she entered, wherewithal
    I ever burn. The Good which sates this court
    is alpha and omega of all scriptures
    Love reads to me in tones or low or loud.”

    And that same voice which rid me of the fear
    the sudden blinding blaze had given me,
    inspired me with a wish to speak again,

    and said: “Thou surely through a finer sieve
    must pass thy meaning; it behooves thee say
    who toward so great a target turned thy bow.”

    And I: “By philosophic arguments,
    and by authority which from up here descends,
    must such a love needs stamp itself on me;
    because the good, when understood as such,
    enkindles love, and all the greater love,
    the more it holds of goodness in itself.
    Hence to that Being who so perfect is,
    that every good which lies outside of Him
    is nothing but a beam of His own radiance,
    more than to any other must the mind
    in love be moved, of all who recognize
    the truth on which this argument is based.
    He to mine understanding shows this truth,
    who demonstrates to me the Primal Love
    of all the sempiternal substances;
    the Truthful Author’s voice revealeth it,
    when, speaking of Himself, He saith to Moses:
    ‘All goodness shall I have thee see.’ Thou, too,
    revealest it to me when thou beginnest
    the loud announcement which o’er other trumps
    heralds on earth the secrets of this state.”

    Thereat I heard: “By human understanding,
    and by authorities therewith concordant,
    the sovereign of thy loves is turned to God.

    But further say if other cords thou feel
    attract thee toward Him; so that thou mayst say
    how many of love’s teeth are biting thee.”

    Not hidden was the purpose of Christ’s Eagle;
    nay, rather, I perceived to what he wished
    to lead my love’s profession to declare;
    hence, “All those bitings” I began again,
    “which possibly could turn one’s heart to God,
    have with my love of Him concurrent been;
    for, both the world’s existence, and mine own,
    the death which He endured that I might live,
    and that which all the faithful hope as I,
    together with the mentioned living knowledge,
    have drawn me from the sea of wrong desires,
    and set me on the shore of righteous love.

    I love the several leaves wherewith enleaved
    is all the garden of the Eternal Gardener,
    according to the good He giveth each.”

    As soon as I had ceased, a most sweet song
    throughout all heaven resounded, and my Lady
    said: “Holy, Holy, Holy!” with the rest.

    And ev’n as at a vivid flash of light
    one wakes from sleep, because one’s visual power
    turns toward the ray which moves from coat to coat;
    and as the one awakened shrinketh back
    from that which he hath seen, so senseless is
    his sudden waking, till reflection helps;

    thus Beatrice drove all motes from mine eyes
    by the mere radiance of her own, whose light
    shone further than a thousand miles away;
    I, therefore, saw far better than before;
    then, since I was amazed at it, I asked
    about a fourth light I beheld with us.

    My Lady then: “In yonder radiant light
    the first soul which the first Power e’er created
    is gazing joyfully upon his Maker.”

    Even as a bough which, while the wind is passing,
    bends its top down, and then uplifts itself,
    by innate strength which raises it again;
    even so did I, amazed, while she was speaking;
    and then the wish to speak, wherewith I burned,
    made me feel reassured, and I began:

    “O fruit that wast alone produced when ripe,
    O ancient Father, thou to whom each bride
    is both a daughter and a daughter-in-law,
    I beg thee as devoutly as I can
    to speak to me; thou see’st my wish, hence I,
    that I may quickly hear thee, tell it not.”

    At times a covered animal so stirs,
    that its own movement needs must be revealed,
    because its covering corresponds to it;
    so likewise did the first of souls display
    to me, through that which covered it, how gladly
    he came to give me pleasure. Then it breathed:

    “Without its being told to me by thee,
    better do I perceive what thou desirest,
    than thou perceivest what thou knowest best;
    for I behold it in the Truthful Mirror,
    which of Itself makes other things a likeness,
    though naught makes It a likeness of itself.
    Thou fain wouldst hear how long it is since God
    in that high garden placed me, where this Lady
    prepared thee for so long a flight of stairs;
    how long it was a pleasure to mine eyes;
    the real occasion for the mighty wrath;
    and what the tongue, which I both used and made.

    Now, son, the tasting of the tree was not
    itself the cause of such a banishment,
    but only the transgression of the bound.
    In that place, whence thy Lady started Virgil,
    I, hence, for this assembly longed four thousand
    three hundred revolutions of the sun
    and two; and him I saw return again
    to all his highway’s lights nine hundred times
    and thirty, while I still abode on earth.
    The tongue I spoke had quite extinct become
    a long time e’er the people under Nimrod
    attempted their unfinishable task;
    for never was a product of man’s reason
    apt to endure, for human appetite
    renews itself according to the heavens.

    That mankind speaks, a work of Nature is,
    but if in this or that way, Nature then
    leaves you to do according to your pleasure.
    Ere I descended to the grieving place
    below, the Highest Good, from whom proceeds
    the joy which swathes me, was on earth called I;
    EL was He called thereafter; this must be,
    for human custom is, as on a bough
    a leaf, which goeth as another comes.
    Upon the Mount which highest from the sea
    ascends, I lived, in innocence and sin,
    from the first hour until the one which follows,
    after the sun’s first quadrant change, the sixth.”

PARADISO XXVII

The Eighth or Starry Heaven. St. Peter’s Invective

The Ninth Heaven. Primum Mobile. The Angelic Hierarchies

    “Glory to Father, Son and Holy Ghost!”
    all Paradise in such a way began,
    that its sweet song intoxicated me.
    What I was seeing seemed to me a smile
    as of the Universe; for through both sight
    and hearing my intoxication entered.

    O joy! O gladness inexpressible!
    O life by love and peace completely filled!
    O wealth no longer longed for, but assured!

    Before mine eyes the torches four remained
    on fire, and that which was the first to come,
    began to grow more luminous; and such
    in its appearance it became, as Jove
    would come to be, if he and Mars were birds,
    and interchanged the plumage of their wings.

    The Providence, which there above assigns
    both turn and office, silence had imposed
    upon the blessèd choir on every side,
    when “If I change my color, marvel not”;
    I heard him say, “for ev’n while I am speaking,
    thou shalt behold all these change color, too.

    He who on earth usurps my place, my place,
    my place, which in the sight
    of God’s own Son
    is vacant, of my burial ground hath made
    a sewer of blood and stench; whereby the Pervert,
    who fell from hence, is there below appeased.”

    The whole of Heaven I then beheld o’erspread
    with that same hue which colors clouds both morn
    and evening, when the sun lies opposite;
    and as a modest lady, who feels sure
    of her own self, but at another’s fault,
    on merely hearing of it, timid grows;
    so Beatrice changed her appearance then,
    and such as hers, I think, was Heaven’s eclipse,
    what time the Sovereign Power suffered pain.

    Thereat his words proceeded in a voice
    so changed from what had been its wonted self,
    that his appearance had no further changed:

    “The Bride of Christ was not by my blood fed,
    nor by the blood of Linus, nor by that
    of Cletus, to be used for gain of gold;
    but for the winning of this happy life,
    both Sixtus, Pius, Urban and Calixtus
    after much lamentation shed their blood.
    ’T was not our purpose that upon the right
    of our successors one part of the folk
    of Christ should sit, and on the left another;

    nor that the Keys bestowed in trust on me,
    should on a banner come to be an emblem,
    and warfare wage on those that were baptized;
    nor I become an image on a seal
    for privileges venal and deceptive,
    which often make me blush and flame with wrath.
    Rapacious wolves disguised in shepherds’ clothes
    are seen in all the pastures from up here.
    Vengeance of God, why art thou quiet still?
    Men of Cahors and Gascons even now
    prepare to drink our blood. O good beginning,
    to what vile ending thou art doomed to fall!
    But that high Providence, which saved for Rome,
    through Scipio’s help, the glory of the world,
    will quickly succor her, as I conceive;
    and thou, my son, who, for thy mortal weight
    art to return below, open thy mouth,
    and hide not that which I do not conceal!”

    Ev’n as our atmosphere lets fall great flakes
    of frozen vapor, when the horn of heaven’s
    she-Goat is in conjunction with the sun;
    so I beheld the sky grow beautiful
    and upward flaked with those triumphant flames
    which for a while had sojourned with us there.

    My sight was following their forms, and followed,
    till the mid space, by reason of its vastness,
    prevented it from passing further on.

    Thereat the Lady who had seen that freed
    I was from gazing up, said: “Lower now
    thine eyes, and see how far thou hast revolved.”

    I saw that since the hour when I had first
    looked downward, I had moved through all the arc
    the first of climates makes from mid to end;
    past Cadiz, hence, Ulysses’ insane track
    I saw, and nearly to the seashore where
    Europa made herself so sweet a load.
    And of this little threshing-floor, much more
    would have been shown me; but the sun was circling
    beneath my feet, a sign or more removed.

    And my enamored mind, which in my Lady
    always takes pleasure, more than ever now
    was burning to restore mine eyes to her.
    And if or art or Nature e’er made baits
    in human flesh or in its painted forms,
    to catch men’s eyes, and capture thus their minds,
    they all together would seem naught, compared
    to that divine delight which on me shone,
    when to her smiling face I turned around;
    the virtue, therefore, which that look vouchsafed,
    removed me from fair Leda’s lovely nest,
    and urged me on into the swiftest heaven.

    Its nearest and its most exalted parts
    are all so uniform, I cannot tell
    which Beatrice selected as my place.

    But she who saw my wish began to speak,
    and smiled so happily, that God appeared
    to be rejoicing in her countenance:

    “The nature of the world, which quiet holds
    the center, and around it moves the rest,
    beginneth here as from its starting-point.
    And this heaven hath no other ‘where’ than in
    the Mind Divine, where kindled is the Love
    which turns it, and the Power itself rains down.
    One circle’s Light and Love encircle it,
    as it the other heavens; and He alone
    this precinct understands, who girdeth it.
    Its motion is not measured by another,
    but all the others are by this, as ten
    is measured by its half and by its fifth.
    And now how time in such a flowerport
    can have its hidden roots, and in the rest
    its leaves, hereafter can be manifest to thee.”

    O thou Cupidity, that ’neath thyself
    dost sink all mortals so, that none avails
    out of thy waters to withdraw his eyes!
    The will in human beings blossoms well,
    but constant rains turn into blighted fruit
    the genuine plums.
    And faith and innocence
    are found in children only, but take flight,
    before their cheeks are covered up with hair.

    While still a prattler, one observeth fasts,
    who later, when his tongue is free, devours,
    under whatever moon, whatever food;
    and one who, while still lisping, loves
    and harkens to his mother, later on
    when speaking well, would see her in her grave.
    Thus in the Primal Sight becometh black
    the white face of the lovely child of him,
    who brings the morn and leaves the eventide.
    And that thou marvel not at this, recall
    that there is none on earth who rules; and hence
    the human family goes thus astray.
    And yet ere January’s month become
    wholly unwintered, through the hundredth part
    neglected there below, these upper spheres
    shall roar so, that the storm so long foreseen
    will turn the sterns to where the prows are now,
    so that the fleet will run its course aright,
    and good fruit follow on the blossom’s flower.”

PARADISO XXVIII

The Ninth Heaven. Primum Mobile. The Angelic Hierarchies

The Point. The Nine Orders of Angels and the Nine Heavens

    After the truth against the present life
    of wretched mortals had been shown to me
    by her who lifts my mind to Paradise,
    as in a mirror he perceives its flame,
    who from behind is lighted by a torch,
    before he has it in his sight or thought,
    and turns around to notice if the glass
    have told the truth, and sees that it accords
    therewith, as with its music’s time a song;
    so likewise now my memory recalls
    that I did, as I gazed in those fair eyes,
    whence Love had made a cord to capture me.

    And as I turned around, and mine were touched
    by that which in that sphere becomes apparent,
    whene’er one looks intently at its center,
    a Point I saw, which rays out light so keen
    that eyes which it enkindles needs must close
    by reason of its great intensity;
    and any star that from down here seems smallest,
    would seem to be a moon, if set beside it,
    as at each other’s side the stars are set.

    Perhaps as near as e’er a halo seems
    to gird the light around, which colors it,
    when densest is the air which gives it form;
    a ring of fire was whirling round the Point
    so swiftly, that it would have overcome
    the motion which most quickly girds the world;
    and by another this was girt around,
    that by a third, as this one by a fourth,
    then by a fifth the fourth, and by a sixth
    the fifth. The seventh came next, outside of these
    so widely spread, that Juno’s messenger,
    full circled, were too narrow to contain it.
    Like these the eighth ring and the ninth; and each
    more slowly moved, as in its order’s number
    it whirled at greater distance from the first;
    and that one had the clearest flame of all,
    whence the Pure Spark least distant was, because,
    I think, it most in-truths itself therein.

    My Lady, who profoundly lost in thought
    beheld me, said to me: “On yonder Point
    Heaven and the whole of Nature are dependent.
    Look at the circle most conjoined to It;
    and know thou that it moves so rapidly
    because spurred onward by its burning love.”

    And I to her: “If ordered were the world
    as I perceive it is in yonder wheels,
    what is before me set had sated me;

    but in the world of sense all revolutions
    may be perceived to be the more divine
    as from the center they are more remote;
    hence, if my longing is to be appeased
    in this mirific and angelic temple,
    whose only boundaries are light and love,
    ’t is fit that I hear further why the example
    and its exemplar do not correspond;
    for by myself I think on this in vain.”

    “No wonder is it, if for such a knot
    thy fingers insufficient are, so hard
    hath it become, through lack of being tried!”

    My Lady thus; she then continued: “Take
    what I shall tell thee, wouldst thou sated be;
    and on it subtly concentrate thy mind.
    The embodied circles wide or narrow are,
    according to the more or less of virtue
    distributed through all their several parts.
    A greater goodness makes for greater weal;
    a greater body greater weal bespeaks,
    if all its parts are perfect equally.
    Hence that which with itself sweeps onward all
    the universe remaining, corresponds
    to yonder circle which most loves and knows.
    If, then, thou stretch thy measure round the virtue,
    not round the appearance, of the substances
    which seem arranged in circles to thy sight,

    thou ’lt see a marvelous conformity
    of more to larger and of less to smaller,
    in every heaven, to its Intelligence.”

    Even as the hemisphere of air remains
    resplendent and serene, when Boreas blows
    out of the cheek, from which he mildest proves,
    whereby the fog which troubled it before,
    is cleansed and cleared, until the welkin smiles
    upon us with the charms of all its wards;
    even such did I become, when once my Lady
    had with her clear reply provided me,
    and, like a star in heaven, the truth was seen.

    And when her words had ceased, not otherwise
    doth iron when still boiling scintillate,
    than yonder circles sparkled. Every spark
    followed its Kindler; and so many were they,
    that their whole number far more thousands counts,
    than ever did the doubling of the chess.

    From choir to choir I heard Hosanna sung
    to that Fixed Point which holds them at the ‘where,’
    and ever will, where they have always been.

    And she who in my mind my doubtful thoughts
    was seeing, said: “The primal rings have shown
    the Seraphs to thee, and the Cherubim.
    Thus swiftly do they heed their bonds, to make them
    as like the Point as may be, and as like It
    they can be, as their vision is sublime.

    Those other loves that round about them move,
    Thrones of the Countenance Divine are called,
    and for this reason end the primal triad.
    And thou shouldst know that all of them are happy,
    according as their vision plumbs the Truth,
    wherein all understanding is at rest.
    From this it may be seen how blessedness
    is founded on the faculty which sees,
    and not on that which loves and follows after;
    the measure of this vision is the merit,
    which both of Grace and of good will is born;
    such, then, is their advance from grade to grade.

    The second triad which, like that above,
    produces buds in this eternal spring,
    whose foliage no nocturnal Aries spoils,
    sings endlessly its vernal song of praise
    to three sweet melodies, which sound in three
    orders of joy, wherewith it trines itself.
    Three goddesses are in that hierarchy;
    the Dominations first, the Virtues next;
    the third one is the Order of the Powers.

    Then, in the last two dancing choirs but one,
    with Principalities Archangels whirl;
    the last is wholly of Angelic Joys.

    All these Angelic orders upward look,
    and downward so prevail, that all to God
    attracted are, and all in turn attract.

    And Dionysius with such great desire
    gave himself up to contemplate these orders,
    that he both named and graded them as I;
    but with him, later, Gregory disagreed,
    and hence, as soon as ever in this heaven
    he oped his eyes, at his own self he smiled.

    Nor would I have thee wonder that on earth
    a mortal should disclose a truth so secret,
    for he who saw it here, revealed it to him,
    with many other truths about these rings.”

PARADISO XXIX

The Ninth Heaven. Primum Mobile. The Angelic Hierarchies

The Creation, the Nature and the Number of the Angels

    When, by the Ram and by the Scales surmounted,
    both children of Latona make together
    a girdle of the earth’s horizon line,
    as long as from the moment when the zenith
    holds them in equipoise, till from that girdle
    both free themselves by changing hemisphere;
    only so long did Beatrice keep silent,
    a smile her face adorning, as she gazed
    intently on the Point which vanquished me.

    She then began: “I tell, but do not ask,
    what thou art fain to hear, for I have seen it
    where every Where and every When is fixed.

    Not for the gain of good unto Himself,
    which is not possible, but that His Splendor
    might in resplendency declare ‘I AM,’
    in His Eternity, outside of time,
    out of all limits else, the Eternal Love,
    as pleased Him, in new loves disclosed Himself.
    Nor yet ere this did He remain inert,
    for neither after nor before, occurred
    God’s going to and fro upon these waters.

    Both form and matter, simple and conjoined,
    came into being which had no defect,
    even as three arrows from a three-stringed bow;
    and as in glass, in amber or in crystal,
    a ray so shines, that from the time it comes
    till its completion, is no interval;
    thus from its Lord did that triform effect
    ray forth into its being all at once,
    without distinction as to its beginning.

    Order was concreate, and for the substances
    ordained; and highest in the world were those
    in whom activity was brought forth pure.
    Pure potentiality the lowest place assumed;
    and ’tween these two so strong a bond activity
    and potentiality conjoined, that never will it be unbound.

    Jerome concerning Angels wrote for you
    that their creation was an age-long tract
    of time before the remnant world was made;
    but written is this truth in many places
    by writers of the Holy Ghost; and there
    thou ’lt see it, if but carefully thou look;
    and reason, too, sees this to some extent,
    for it could not acknowledge that the Motors
    could be so long deprived of their perfection.

    And now thou knowest where and when these loves
    created were, and how; hence in thy longing
    three ardors have already been extinguished.

    Nor, counting, would one reach as far as twenty,
    as quickly as a portion of the Angels
    disturbed the lowest of your elements.
    The rest remained; and with such great delight
    began the art, which thou beholdest here,
    that never from their circling have they ceased.
    The Fall’s occasion was the cursèd pride
    of him, whom thou didst see oppressed by all
    the burdens of the world. Those whom thou here
    beholdest, modest were, and recognized
    themselves as from that Goodness sprung, which apt
    had made them for such great intelligence.
    And therefore by illuminating Grace,
    and by their merit, was their sight so raised,
    that now a full and steadfast will is theirs.
    Nor would I have thee doubt, but be assured,
    that to receive God’s Grace is meritorious,
    according as affection opes to it.

    And now concerning this consistory,
    much canst thou contemplate without more help,
    if thou hast apprehended well my words.
    But seeing that on earth throughout your schools
    men teach that such the Angelic nature is,
    that it both understands, recalls and wills,
    I’ll further speak, that thou the simple truth
    mayst see, which there below confounded is,
    because the doctrine taught equivocates.

    These substances, e’er since the face of God
    first gladdened them, have not withdrawn
    their eyes therefrom, whence nothing is concealed.
    They have no vision which is interrupted,
    therefore, by objects new to them, and hence
    need not remember by divided thought;
    folk, therefore, dream down there, though not asleep,
    some thinking that their words are true, some not;
    but greater is the latter’s sin and shame.

    And ye down yonder follow not one path,
    when ye philosophize; so much doth love
    of show, and being famed for it, transport you.
    And yet with even less disdain is this
    endured up here, than when the Holy Scripture
    is set aside, or turned to wrong account.
    No one considers there how much it costs
    to sow it in the world, or how much he,
    who humbly clings to it, gives pleasure here.
    Each strives to call attention to himself,
    making his own inventions; these are taught
    by preachers, while the Gospel’s voice is stilled.
    One says that while the Christ was suffering death
    the moon turned back, and interposed herself;
    and hence the sun’s light failed to reach the earth;
    others that of its own accord the light
    concealed itself, hence its eclipse affected
    Spaniards and Hindoos, as it did the Jews.

    Florence hath not so many Lapi and Bindi
    as fables such as these, which all year long
    are shouted from the pulpits everywhere;
    hence the poor sheep, who do not know, return
    from pasture fed on wind; nor doth the fact
    that they see not that they are harmed, excuse them.
    Christ did not say to His first company:
    “Go and preach idle stories to the world!”
    but gave them a foundation for the truth;
    and that alone found utterance from their lips;
    therefore, when striving to enkindle faith,
    they used the Gospel as their shield and lance.
    Men now go forth to preach with jests and tricks,
    and so, if but a hearty laugh is raised,
    the cowl puffs up, and nothing more is asked.
    But in its tail there nestles such a bird,
    that if the crowd perceived it, it would see
    what that forgiveness is, in which it trusts;
    therefore such folly hath increased on earth,
    that without proof or other attestation,
    to any kind of promise men would flock.
    Saint Anthony is fattening thus his pig,
    and others also fouler far than his,
    by paying money void of coinage stamp.

    But since a great digression we have made,
    turn thine eyes backward to the straight road now,
    that thus our way be shortened with our time.

    This nature so exceedingly extends
    in number, that there never was or speech,
    or mortal thought, that could extend so far.
    And if thou look at that which is disclosed
    by Daniel, thou wilt see that in his ‘thousands’
    no well determined number is revealed.

    The Primal Light, which rays out on it all,
    is in as many ways therein received,
    as are the lights wherewith It pairs Itself;
    hence, since affection follows on the act
    which understands, love’s sweetness is therein
    burning or warm in different degrees.

    And now see how exceeding high and broad
    is that Eternal Worth, which makes Itself
    so many mirrors, whereupon It breaks,
    while in Itself, as erst, remaining One!”

PARADISO XXX

The Empyrean. GOD. The Angels and the Blest. The River of Light. The Mystic Rose. The Throne of Henry VII

    The sixth hour glows perhaps six thousand miles
    away from us, and now our world inclines
    its shadow to a nearly level bed;
    mid-heaven the while, which lies so deep above us,
    is growing such, that now and then a star
    is lost to our perception here below;
    till, as the brightest handmaid of the sun
    advances further, star by star, the sky,
    even to the fairest, closes to our view.

    Not otherwise the Triumph, which forever
    plays round about the Point which vanquished me,
    and seems contained by what Itself contains,
    little by little faded from my sight;
    my seeing nothing, therefore, and my love
    forced me to look again at Beatrice.

    If what has hitherto been said of her
    were all included in a single praise,
    but little would it serve my present turn.
    The beauty which I then beheld, transcends
    not us alone, but truly I believe
    its Maker only can enjoy it all.

    And herewith I confess myself o’erwhelmed
    more than a tragic or a comic poet
    was ever by a crisis in his theme;
    for as the sun the sight that trembles most,
    so the remembrance of her lovely smile
    deprives my memory of its very self.

    From the first day when I beheld her face
    in this life, till this present sight of it,
    I’ve never ceased from following her in song;
    but now must my pursuit desist from tracing
    her beauty’s progress further in my verse,
    as at his utmost every artist must.

    Such, as I leave her to a louder cry
    than that of mine own trump, which draweth now
    its arduous matter to its closing, she,
    with a quick leader’s mien and voice, resumed:

    “We now have issued from the greatest body
    into the Heaven which is itself pure Light;
    Light intellectual which is full of Love,
    Love of true Goodness which is full of Joy;
    Joy which transcendeth every kind of Pleasure.

    Here both the soldieries of Paradise
    shalt thou behold, and one in that array,
    which at the Final Judgment thou shalt see.”

    Like a quick lightning-flash which scatters so
    the visual faculties that it prevents
    the eye’s reacting to the brightest objects;

    ev’n so a living Light around me shone,
    and left me swathed about by such a veil
    of its effulgence, that I lost my sight.

    “The Love which calms this last heaven always welcomes
    into its midst by greetings such as this,
    and thus adapts the candle to the flame.”

    No sooner had these few brief words of hers
    attained mine inner ear, than I perceived
    that I was being raised above my powers;
    hence, with new sight I so rekindled me,
    that there cannot exist so bright a light
    that now mine eyes could not endure to see it.

    Light in a River’s form I then beheld,
    which glowed refulgently between two banks,
    adorned with wondrous hues of early spring.
    And from this River issued living sparks,
    which settled everywhere among the flowers,
    and looked like rubies set in gold; and then,
    as if intoxicated by its odors,
    into the wondrous River plunged again,
    another coming out, if one went in.

    “The deep desire which now inflameth thee,
    and urges thee to know what thou art seeing,
    the better pleases me, the more it grows.
    But of this water it behooves thee drink,
    before so great a thirst as thine is slaked.”
    So said to me the Sunlight of mine eyes.

    “The River and the topaz lights, which come
    and go,” she added, “and the smiling grass
    are prefaces foreshadowing their truth;
    not that imperfect in themselves they are,
    but that deficiency exists in thee,
    because thy sight is not yet strong enough.”

    There is no little child that turns its face
    so quickly toward its milk, on waking up
    much later than hath been its wont, as I,
    to make far better mirrors of mine eyes,
    leaned over toward the Stream which only flows
    that we therein may be the better made.

    Soon as mine eyelids’ eaves had drunk of it,
    it seemed to me transformed from long to round;
    and then, like folk who under masks have been,
    and different seem from what they were before,
    when once divested of the alien looks,
    wherein their self had disappeared; ev’n so
    the flowers and sparks had changed themselves for me
    into a feast far greater, so that clearly
    I now beheld both Courts of Heaven revealed.

    O Splendor of my God, whereby I saw
    the exalted Triumph of the Realm of Truth,
    give me the power to tell what I perceived!

    There is a Light up yonder, which allows
    its Maker to be seen by every creature
    which only hath its peace in seeing Him;

    and in a circle’s form it spreadeth out
    to such extent, that its circumference
    would be too broad a girdle for the sun.
    Its whole appearance from a ray proceeds
    reflected from the summit of the First
    Moved Sphere, which from it takes its life and potency.

    And as within the water at its base
    a hill reflects itself, as if to see
    its slopes adorned, when rich with leaves and flowers;
    thus, ranged above and all around the Light,
    mirrored on o’er a thousand tiers I saw
    all that of us have yet returned up there.
    And if the lowest row within itself
    gathers so great a light, how great must be
    this Rose’s width in its remotest petals?

    Nor did my vision of its breadth or height
    lose itself in them, but embraced the whole
    extent and inmost nature of this Joy.
    There near, nor far, nor add, nor take away;
    for there where God unmediated rules,
    in no way doth the natural law obtain.

    Into the yellow of the Eternal Rose,
    which outward spreads in tiers, whose fragrance praises
    the Sun which makes an everlasting spring,
    was I, like one who, fain to speak, keeps silent,
    led on by Beatrice, who said to me:
    “Behold how vast the white robed Convent is!

    Behold how wide the circuit of our Town!
    Behold our benches so completely filled,
    that few are now the people longed for here!

    On that great seat, whereon thine eyes are fixed
    by reason of the crown which rests there now,
    or e’er thou sup at this our wedding feast,
    shall sit the soul, august to be below,
    of that great Henry who shall come to set
    Italia straight, ere she shall be prepared.
    The blinding greed which now bewitches you
    hath made you mortals like a child, who, though
    he die of hunger, drives his nurse away.

    And in the sacred Forum such an one
    shall Prefect be, that he’ll not go one road
    with him, in open or in covert ways.
    But in his holy office he will not
    be long endured by God; for hurled he’ll be
    where Simon Magus is for his reward,
    and deeper down shall thrust Alagna’s man.”

PARADISO XXXI

The Empyrean. GOD. The Angels and the Blest. St. Bernard

Dante’s Last Words with Beatrice. The Glory of Mary

    In semblance, therefore, of a pure white Rose
    the sacred soldiery which with His blood
    Christ made His Bride, revealed itself to me;
    meanwhile the other host, which, flying, sees
    the glory of Him who wins its love, and sings
    the goodness which had made them all so great,
    was, like a swarm of bees, which now inflowers
    itself, and now returns to where its toil
    is sweetened, ever coming down to enter
    the spacious Flower, which with so many leaves
    adorns itself, and reascending thence
    to where its Love forever makes His home.

    The faces of them all were living flames,
    their wings were golden, and the rest so white,
    that never is such whiteness reached by snow.
    When down into the Flower they came, they spread
    from bench to bench the peace and ardent love,
    which by the fanning of their sides they won.
    Nor did so vast a host of flying forms
    between the flower and that which o’er it lies,
    hinder the sight, or dim the splendor seen;

    because the Light Divine so penetrates
    the Universe, according to its worth,
    that naught can be an obstacle thereto.
    And this secure and joyous Kingdom, thronged
    by people of the ages old and new,
    wholly on one Mark set its looks and love.

    O Trinal Light, that in a Single Star,
    sparkling before their eyes, dost so appease them,
    look down upon our tempest here below!

    If the Barbarians — coming from a region,
    above which Helicë looms every day,
    while circling with the son who is her joy,
    on seeing Rome and all her lofty buildings,
    what time the Lateran rose eminent
    o’er every mortal thing — were wonderstruck;
    how overwhelmed with awe must I have been,
    I, who from human things, to things divine,
    from time, into eternity had come,
    from Florence — to a people just and sane!
    Because of this, indeed, and of my joy,
    it pleased me to be mute and hear no sound.

    And ev’n as in the temple of his vow,
    when hoping to describe it all some day,
    a pilgrim looks around him, and is cheered;
    ev’n so, while wandering through the living Light,
    I turned mine eyes on all the graded ranks,
    circling now up, now down, and now around.

    There love-persuasive faces I beheld,
    decked by Another’s light and their own smiles,
    and gestures fraught with grace and dignity.

    My look now as a whole had comprehended
    the general form of Paradise, but had not yet
    settled especially on any part;
    and I was longing with rekindled wish
    to ask my Lady as to many things,
    concerning which my mind was in suspense.

    Though one thing I had meant, another answered;
    thinking to look at Beatrice, an elder
    I saw arrayed as are the glorious folk.
    His eyes and cheeks were all suffused with joy
    and kindliness, and such his pious mien,
    as fitting is a father’s tenderness.

    Hence “Where is she?” I said impulsively;
    and he: “To bring thy longing to an end,
    was I by Beatrice from mine own place
    withdrawn; and if upon the highest rank’s
    third round thou look, thou shalt again behold her
    enthroned where her deserts allotted her.”

    Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,
    and saw her, as, reflecting from herself
    the eternal rays, she made herself a crown.
    Not from the tract whence highest thunders peal
    is any mortal eye so far removed
    from whatsoever sea it fathoms most.

    as Beatrice was distant from mine eyes;
    but naught was that to me, because her face
    came down to me unblurred by aught between.

    “O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,
    and who for my salvation didst endure
    to leave the traces of thy feet in Hell,
    I recognize the virtue and the grace
    of all the many things which I have seen,
    as coming from thy power and kindliness.
    From slavery to freedom thou hast drawn me
    in every way, and over every path,
    within thy power to achieve that end.
    Guard thou in me the fruitage of thy bounty,
    that thus my soul, restored to health by thee,
    may, when it leaves my body, please thee still!”

    I thus implored; and she, though so far off
    she seemed, looked down at me and smiled;
    then to the Eternal Fount she turned again.

    Thereat the holy elder said: “That thou
    mayst bring thy journey to its perfect end,
    for which both prayers and holy love have sent me,
    hover about this Garden with thine eyes,
    for to have seen it will prepare thy look
    to rise still higher through the Ray Divine.
    The Queen of Heaven, for whom I wholly burn
    with love, will grant us this and very grace,
    for I her faithful servant Bernard am.”

    As he who from Croatia comes, perchance,
    to look at our Veronica, and who,
    because of its old fame, is never sated,
    but says in thought, as long as it is shown:
    “My Lord, Christ Jesus, God in very truth,
    was, then, your countenance like unto this?”
    even such was I, as on the living love
    I gazed on him, who in this world received
    a taste, in contemplation, of that Peace.

    “This glad existence, son of Grace,” he then
    began, “will not be known to thee, if fixed
    at this low level only are thine eyes.
    Look at the circles, to the most remote,
    till yonder thou behold that Queen enthroned,
    to whom devoutly subject is this Realm.”

    I raised mine eyes; and as at early morn
    the horizon’s eastern parts excel in light
    the regions where the sun is setting; so,
    as with mine eyes from vale to mount I moved,
    I saw a region at the utmost verge
    vanquish in light all other parts before me.
    And as the skies where one awaits the car
    which Phaethon badly drove, more brightly gleam,
    while pale the light on either side becomes;
    so likewise, brilliant in the middle loomed
    that peaceful Oriflamme, and on each side
    the fire in equal measure burned less bright.

    And clustered there with wings outspread I saw
    more than a thousand Angels jubilant,
    and each distinct in splendor and in speed;
    while smiling down upon their sports and songs
    a Beauty I beheld, who was the joy
    within the eyes of all the other Saints.
    And even if I in utterance were as rich
    as in imagination, I ’d not dare
    attempt to tell the least of its delight.

    When Bernard saw mine eyes intently fixed
    upon the object of his ardent love,
    he turned to it his own with such affection,
    that mine more eager grew to look again.

PARADISO XXXII

The Empyrean. GOD. The Angels and the Blest. The Order of the Rose. The Blessed Children. The Great Patricians

    Intent on his delight, that contemplator
    the office of a teacher took unasked,
    and thereupon began these holy words:

    “The one so beautiful at Mary’s feet
    is she who opened and who made the wound,
    which Mary closed again, and then anointed.
    In the order which up there the third seats make,
    Rachel beneath her sits with Beatrice,
    as thou perceivest.

    Sarah, Rebecca, Judith,
    and she who was that singer’s ancestress,
    who said when he was grieving for his sin:
    “Have mercy on me,” thou canst thus behold
    downward from rank to rank, as each I name,
    and through the Rose decline from leaf to leaf.

    Descending from the seventh row of seats,
    even as above it, Hebrew women follow,
    dividing all the tresses of the Flower;
    for in accordance with the attitude
    their faith assumed toward Christ, these women form
    the wall which separates the sacred steps.

    On this side, where full-bloomed the Flower is,
    complete with all its leaves, are seated those
    who in the Christ that was to come believed;
    and on the other, where the semicircles
    are interrupted by still vacant seats,
    are those who faced toward Christ already come.

    And as on this side here the glorious throne
    of Heaven’s own Lady, and the other seats
    beneath it, such a great partition make;
    so, opposite, the seat of that great John,
    who, ever holy, underwent the desert
    and martyrdom, and then two years in Hades;
    while Francis, Benedict and Augustine
    beneath him were decreed to form the line
    with others down to here, from round to round.

    And now behold how great God’s foresight is;
    for each of these two aspects of the Faith
    will fill this Garden to the same extent.

    And know that downward from the row of seats,
    which midway separates the two divisions,
    no one is seated for his own deserts,
    but for another’s, under fixed conditions;
    for all of these are spirits who were freed
    before they had the power to really choose.
    This by their faces thou canst well perceive,
    and by their childish voices furthermore,
    if, looking at them well, thou listen, too.

    Thou doubtest now, and, doubting, thou art silent;
    but I will set thee free from that strong bond
    wherein thy subtle thoughts are holding thee.

    Within the ample nature of this Realm
    nothing can any more occur by chance,
    than either sadness, thirst or hunger can;
    for in accordance with eternal law
    is settled all thou seest, so that here
    close-fitting to the finger is the ring.
    These people, therefore, who before their time
    have reached true life, are not without good cause
    more excellent, or less, among themselves.
    The King, through whom this Kingdom finds repose
    in such delight and love, that no one’s will
    is bold enough to long for any greater;
    creating all minds in His own glad sight,
    as Him it pleases, dowers each with Grace
    in divers ways; here let the fact suffice.
    And this is clearly and expressly marked
    for you in Holy Scripture by those twins
    who in their mother had their wrath aroused.
    According to the color of the hair
    of that Grace, therefore, must the Light supreme
    be worthily accorded as a crown.
    Without deserving aught, then, for their deeds,
    are these to different grades assigned, which differ
    in their innate keen-sightedness alone.

    The faith of parents only was, indeed,
    with innocence, enough for their salvation,
    throughout the centuries of early times.
    Then, when the primal ages had elapsed,
    males were by circumcision forced to win
    the virtue needed by their guileless wings;
    but later, when the age of Grace had come,
    without the perfect baptism in the Christ,
    such innocence was there below retained.

    But now look at the face which to the Christ
    is most resemblant; for its light alone
    can make thee ready to behold the Christ.”

    I saw such gladness raining down on her,
    borne by those holy minds, created such
    that they might fly across those altitudes,
    that whatsoever I had seen before
    ne’er held me with such admiration poised,
    nor showed me such resemblance unto God.

    And that same love which first descended there,
    “Ave Maria, Gratia plena,” singing,
    spread out his open wings in front of her.
    And on all sides the beatific Court
    made such an answer to the song divine,
    that every face became the more serene.

    “O holy father, who for me dost bear
    to be down here, and leave the pleasant place,
    where by eternal lot thou hast thy seat,

    who is that Angel who with such delight
    is at our Queen’s eyes gazing, and is so
    enamored, that he seems to be on fire?”

    For teaching I had thus recourse again
    to him who was from Mary drawing beauty,
    as from the sun the early morning star.

    And he to me: “As much self-trust and grace
    as can be in an Angel or a soul,
    are all in him; and we would have it so;
    for he it was who carried down the palm
    to Mary, when God’s Son upon Himself
    was pleased to take the burden of our flesh.

    But with thine eyes now follow after me,
    as I keep speaking; and note the great Patricians
    of this most just and kind Imperial State.
    The two that have the happiest seats up there,
    because the nearest to Augusta’s throne,
    are, as it were, the two roots of this Rose.
    He that upon the left is at her side,
    that Father is, because of whose bold taste
    the human species tastes such bitterness;
    and on her right thou see’st that ancient Father
    of Holy Church, to whom Christ gave in trust
    the Keys of this fair Flower. And he who saw,
    ere dying, all that fair Bride’s troubled days,
    who with the spear and with the nails was won,
    beside him sits; and at the other’s side

    that Leader rests, ’neath whom the ingrate folk,
    stiff-necked and fickle-minded, lived on manna.

    Anna thou seest sitting opposite
    to Peter, so content to see her daughter,
    that never from her doth she move her eyes,
    although ‘Hosanna!’ singing; o’er against
    the oldest Father of a family
    Lucìa sits, who had thy Lady go,
    when thou thy brows in downward flight didst turn.

    But since apace thy slumber-time is fleeing,
    here will we pause, as that good tailor does,
    who cuts his gown according to his cloth;
    and toward the Primal Love direct our eyes,
    that, looking toward Him, thou mayst penetrate
    as far into His Splendor as thou canst.
    But lest, perchance, by moving thine own wings,
    thou shouldst recede, believing to advance,
    Grace needs must be obtained for thee by prayer;
    Grace from the one who hath the power to help thee;
    hence follow after me with thine affection,
    that from my words thy heart turn not aside.”

    He then began the following holy prayer:

PARADISO XXXIII

The Empyrean. GOD. St. Bernard’s Prayer to Mary

The Vision of God. Ultimate Salvation

    “O Virgin Mother, Daughter of thy Son,
    humbler and loftier than any creature,
    eternal counsel’s predetermined goal,
    thou art the one that such nobility
    didst lend to human nature, that its Maker
    scorned not to make Himself what He had made.
    Within thy womb rekindled was the Love,
    through whose warm influence in the eternal Peace
    this Flower hath blossomed thus. Here unto us
    thou art a noonday torch of Charity;
    and down below ’mong mortal men, thou art
    a living fount of Hope. Lady, so great
    thou art, and hast such worth, that one who longs
    for Grace, and unto thee hath not recourse,
    wingless would wish to have his longing fly.
    Not only doth thy Kindliness give help
    to him that asketh it, but many times
    it freely runs ahead of his request.
    In thee is Mercy, Pity is in thee,
    in thee Magnificence, and all there is
    of Goodness in a creature meets in thee.

    Now doth this man, who from the lowest drain
    of the Universe hath one by one beheld,
    as far as here, the forms of spirit-life,
    beseech thee, of thy grace, for so much strength
    that with his eyes he may uplift himself
    toward Ultimate Salvation higher still.
    And I, who never for mine own sight burned
    more than I do for his, offer thee all
    my prayers, and pray that they be not too poor,
    that thou with thy prayers so dissolve each cloud
    of his mortality, that unto him
    the Highest Pleasure may unfold Itself.
    And furthermore, I pray to thee, O Queen,
    who canst whate’er thou wilt, that, after such
    a sight, thou keep all his affections sound.
    His human promptings let thy care defeat;
    see with how many blest ones Beatrice
    is clasping for my prayers her hands to thee!”

    The eyes belovèd and revered by God,
    intent on him who prayed, revealed to us
    how grateful unto her are earnest prayers.
    Thence they addressed them to the Eternal Light,
    wherein it may not be believed the eye
    of any creature finds so clear a way.

    And I, who to the End of all desires
    was drawing near, within me, as I ought,
    brought to its goal the ardor of desire.

    Bernard was smiling, and was making signs
    for me to look on high; but, as he wished,
    I was already of mine own accord;
    because my sight, as purer it became,
    was penetrating more and more the radiance
    of that High Light, which of Itself is true.

    From this time onward greater was my sight
    than is our speech, which yields to such a vision,
    and memory also yields to such excess.

    And such as he, who seeth in a dream,
    and after it, the imprinted feeling stays,
    while all the rest returns not to his mind;
    even such am I; for almost wholly fades
    my vision, yet the sweetness which was born
    of it is dripping still into my heart.

    Even thus the snow is in the sun dissolved;
    even thus the Sibyl’s oracles, inscribed
    on flying leaves, were lost adown the wind.

    O Light Supreme, that dost uplift Thyself
    so far from mortal thought, relend my mind
    a little of what Thou didst seem to be,
    and cause my tongue to be so powerful,
    that of Thy Glory it may leave at least
    a spark unto the people still to come;
    for to my mem’ry if it but a while
    return, and speak a little in these lines,
    more of Thy Victory will be conceived.

    I think the keenness of the living Ray
    which I endured would have confounded me,
    if from it I had turned away mine eyes.
    And I recall that I, because of this,
    the bolder was to bear it, till I made
    my vision one with Value Infinite.

    O the abundant Grace, whereby I dared
    to pierce the Light Eternal with my gaze,
    until I had therein exhausted sight!

    I saw that far within its depths there lies,
    by Love together in one volume bound,
    that which in leaves lies scattered through the world;
    substance and accident, and modes thereof,
    fused, as it were, in such a way, that that,
    whereof I speak, is but One Simple Light.

    This union’s general form I think I saw,
    since, saying so, I feel that I the more
    rejoice. Of more forgetfulness for me
    one moment is, than centuries twenty-five
    are for the enterprise which once caused Neptune
    to wonder at the shadow Argo cast.

    My mind, thus wholly in suspense, was gazing
    steadfast and motionless, and all intent,
    and, gazing, grew enkindled more and more.

    Such in that Light doth one at last become,
    that one can never possibly consent
    to turn therefrom for any other sight;

    because the Good, which is the will’s real object,
    is therein wholly gathered, and, outside,
    that is defective which is perfect there.

    Ev’n as to what I do remember, mine
    will now be shorter than an infant’s speech,
    who at the breast still bathes his tongue. ’T was not
    that there was other than a simple semblance
    within the Living Light wherein I gazed,
    which always is what It hath been before;
    but through my sight, which in me, as I looked,
    was gathering strength, because I changed, one sole
    appearance underwent a change for me.

    Within the Lofty Light’s profound and clear
    subsistence there appeared to me three Rings,
    of threefold color and of one content;
    and one, as Rainbow is by Rainbow, seemed
    reflected by the other, while the third
    seemed like a Fire breathed equally from both.

    Oh, how, to my conception, short and weak
    is speech! And this, to what I saw, is such,
    that it is not enough to call it small.

    O Light Eternal, that alone dost dwell
    within Thyself, alone dost understand
    Thyself, and love and smile upon Thyself,
    Self-understanding and Self-understood!

    That Circle which appeared to be conceived
    within Thyself as a Reflected Light,
    when somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,

    within Itself, of Its own very color,
    to me seemed painted with our Human Form;
    whence wholly set upon It was my gaze.

    Like the geometer, who gives himself
    wholly to measuring the circle, nor,
    by thinking, finds the principle he needs;
    ev’n such was I at that new sight. I wished
    to see how to the Ring the Image there
    conformed Itself, and found therein a place;
    but mine own wings were not enough for this;
    had not my mind been smitten by a flash
    of light, wherein what it was willing came.

    Here power failed my high imagining;
    but, like a smoothly moving wheel, that Love
    was now revolving my desire and will,
    which moves the sun and all the other stars.




CRITICAL REMARKS

on
MANZONI'S BETROTHED:
BY

THE COUNT O'MAHONY.
[Translated from the Italian.]

To publish a novel, to analyse, to eulogise it, and recommend its perusal to the good and pious, will appear no doubt very extraordinary, and offend the prejudices of many who have agreed among themselves to consider a novel, whoever may be its author, and whatever may be its subject, form, and design, as a pestilent production. If you ask them why? “Because,” they will reply—“because it is a novel!” The answer is as wise as it is peremptory and decisive, and we will spare ourselves the useless trouble of replying to arguments so profound and powerful. We will, however, submit a few serious reflections to minds of a less elevated order, were it only to prove that we can talk reasonably, even on the subject of novels.

Certainly, if we are understood to designate by the appellation of Novel, the written dreams and extravagant imaginations of a corrupt mind and depraved heart, where illusions are substituted for realities, vice transformed into virtue, crime justified by the passions that lead to its perpetration, and fallacious pictures presented of an ideal world, or criminal apologies for a world too real; if, we say, such are the novels to be condemned and proscribed, none more than ourselves will be disposed to confirm the sentence. The unhappy influence which productions like these have exerted over the minds of youth, and above all, the ravages which their multiplication has within a few years produced, is a fact acknowledged by all, by those who have escaped the contagion of their perusal, as well as by those whom that perusal has injured. With respect to this, the wise and the good are unanimous in their testimony and their anathemas; it is one of those self-evident truths, about which an Englishman or a German might still elaborate many a learned dissertation, but of which we shall take no further notice, certain that we should only repeat much less forcibly and eloquently, that which a thousand writers or orators have said before us.

But there is another point of view under which we must consider novels, or rather the works so called, but which bear, to those which morals and good taste reprobate, no other resemblance than the name. These are, it is true, unhappily few in number, and therefore have not been classed by themselves, but have been comprehended in the common appellation, and included in the general proscription; like an honest man, who, bearing the same name as a rogue, partakes with him the odium of his reputation. But this is an injustice for which we are disposed to claim reparation.

Every work of imagination, in which the author causes ideal personages to speak, think, and act, according to his pleasure, has been stigmatised as a Novel. But, if we allow this rigorous definition, the apologue, so dear to the moralist, is a Novel, and deserving of proscription. We will go further; the parable, which also creates its characters and invents their words and actions, is a novel! But who would dare to call them so? Who would dare profane by this name, those profound allegories, those holy fables, so excellent in truth, and so replete with instruction, which God himself has related to man? Finally, if we peruse the works of the most austere philosophers, and the most severe moralists, without excepting ecclesiastical writers, we shall find among them all, pictures of fancy or ideal histories of imaginary persons, fiction serving as a veil, or rather (we must acknowledge it) as an apology for truth.

Now, we ask, by what unjust caprice would we condemn in the novelist that which we admire and applaud in the moralist and philosopher; or rather, by what title do we interdict to the former the right of being equally philosophical and moral with the latter? If man were without weaknesses and society without imperfections, truth would prevail of itself, and in order to be loved and obeyed, it would need only to be shown in its unadorned purity and undisguised nakedness. But, from the beginning of the world, pride has precipitated man into darkness. Corrupt and blind, a jealous susceptibility is developed in his character, which continually increases in proportion to his blindness and corruptions,—that is to say, the deeper he is plunged in darkness, the more he dreads the light, and it is but by degrees, and under various disguises, that we can hope ultimately to make him endure its full blaze.

Besides, fiction, under divers forms, such as fables, apologues, novels, allegories, and tales, constitutes a large portion of the literature of every nation; to this we may add the utility, nay, even the necessity of disguising truth, in order to make it acceptable to our imperfection; and more than all, the good frequently resulting from these modest productions ought to stimulate those on whom Heaven has bestowed the same kind of talent, to employ it in exposing vice and reforming the corruptions of society.

But if the imperfection and weakness of our hearts render fiction necessary to us, a similar necessity results from the languor and inaction of our minds: for in proportion to the extent of public corruption, individual application of the mind to severe and serious study diminishes. Insensibly all continued exercise of the powers of his understanding becomes irksome to man, and he finally considers thought and ennui to be synonymous terms. This is, without doubt, a deplorable and alarming symptom of the decline of society; but we are obliged to confess its existence, and, not possessing the power of changing, we must submit to its caprices and satisfy its necessities.

Now, whether from instinct or observation, writers appear for some years past to have generally understood the demands of the age; and throughout Europe, men of distinguished talents have employed themselves in answering them. It might be said that Germany, England, Switzerland, and Italy, have formed as it were a literary alliance, which will probably endure longer than their political alliance. As to France, her attention has for fifteen years been attracted to literature as well as to politics; but she has thought it sufficient for her glory to translate foreign books, and for her prosperity to translate foreign constitutions.[1]

However this may be, the new taste for foreign literature is remarkable. Numerous works of imagination have appeared simultaneously of an elevated style and uncommon erudition. The choice, and we may add the gravity, of the subjects, the importance of the action, the extent of the developements, and the fidelity of the descriptions, stamp them with a peculiar character, and oblige us to assign to their authors a distinct rank among novel writers. Although unequal in merit, they may be arranged into two classes. The one, beholding how history was neglected, has endeavoured to restore its influence by reviving our ancient chronicles, and presenting to us in an elegant undress, the same characters from whom we avert our eyes, in the magnificent and stiff accompaniments of their historical costume. The other, less numerous, but, in our opinion, much more happily inspired, afflicted by the cold indifference with which the most excellent works on morals and politics are received, or by the insulting contempt which discards them altogether, has undertaken to allure and amuse the prejudices of the age, in order to correct them. In an imaginary picture, they have specially devoted themselves to describe the great springs of human action, and to bring prominently forward those traits of character, those inflexible criticisms on society, which under such a form will attract attention, when every direct and serious admonition would be rejected. Now, it is to this class of novel writers that Alessandro Manzoni essentially belongs.

And here, a great difficulty presents itself; a work of which the action is so simple, that an analysis of it might be given in half a page, and yet so rich in beauties, that a volume might be written in its praise; between these two extremes, the middle path is not easy to find. For, if we should content ourselves with stating that two villagers, who were betrothed, and about to be united, had been separated by the menaces of a rich and titled robber, calumniated, betrayed by a seeming friend, and aided by the unlooked-for benevolence of an enemy; again persecuted by the tyranny of the great, and then almost immolated by the tyranny of the people, and finally delivered by the pestilence itself; if, we repeat, we confine ourselves to this exposition, we shall have presented to our readers the abstract of the work; but shall we have given them a single idea of its beauties?

If, on the contrary, we would enter on an examination of the characters, and follow them in their developement, what a task we impose on ourselves! For here, what beauty! what truth! what originality! The character of Don Abbondio alone would furnish matter for extensive remark, as it is assuredly one of the most profoundly comic creations of the genius of romance. A coward by nature, and selfish from habit, entering the ecclesiastical order only to find in it powerful protection against future enemies, and a refuge against present terrors, during his whole life he pursues, without a single deviation, the tyrannical vocation of fear. Ever disturbed by the apprehension of being disturbed, and giving himself prodigious trouble in order to secure his tranquillity, the care of his repose takes from him all repose. “A friend to all,” is his device, and “Be quiet,” his habitual reply. For him, the evil committed in secret is preferable to the good which might excite dangerous remark. However, at the bottom of his heart, he still esteems the good and virtuous; as to the wicked, he caresses, and where there is necessity, flatters them; in every controversy, he deems the strongest party to be in the right, but his fear of mistake often prevents him from deciding which is the strongest. In discussions where he is personally involved, he acts not less prudently; he does not grant concessions, he does more, he freely offers them, as by so doing he saves the honour of his authority. Indeed, he does not drop a word nor risk a gesture, of which he has not previously weighed the consequences. So that by calculation and foresight, he is prepared for all, except the performance of duty under circumstances of peril and difficulty; to this he closes his ears and his eyes, and thus compromises with the world and his conscience.

And here, let us add, that if any of our readers discover, in this character, the intention, or even the possibility, of an application injurious to religion, they understand but little the mind of the author, which is constantly animated by the most ardent faith, and imbued, we may say, with its highest inspirations. The curate Abbondio appears before us chiefly to give greater relief to the sublime figures of the friar Christopher, and the holy archbishop of Milan, and to furnish materials for scenes between these three characters, where the weakness, the cowardice, and the selfishness of the one serves to brighten, by contrast, the courage, devotion, and heroism of the others. It is an eminently philosophical conception to portray three men entering the priesthood from such different motives, in the course of their long lives, disclosing faithfully in their actions, the sources of their primitive choice. A lesson indeed! from which we may learn what religion can do with men, when they obey its laws and devote themselves to its service, and what men can do with religion, when they subject it to their caprices, or prostitute it to their interests.

But it is in the conversion of the formidable Unknown, that religion appears in all its power, and its pontiff in all the majesty of his benevolence. The interview between these two persons, the one the terror, the other the beloved of his country; the proud criminal humbling himself before the most humble of the just; the former preserving in his profound humiliation the traces of his habitual wickedness and pride, and the latter, with humility equally profound, the majestic authority of unsullied virtue. This scene, conceived and executed with equal genius, combines within itself the deepest interest, and the highest beauty.

As an illustration of the ingenuity and discernment of the author, we will offer one remark further; he has placed before us two wicked men; the one a subaltern robber, a libertine of the second rank, a swaggerer in debauch, vainer of his vices than jealous of his pleasures. The other a superior genius, who has measured how far man could descend in crime, and himself reached its depths, where he governs human corruption as its sovereign, committing no act of violence without leaving the impression of his unlimited power and inexorable will. One of these is to be converted; which will it be? The least guilty? No; coward in vice, where would he find courage to repent? He will die hardened and impenitent. It is the grand criminal who will be drawn from the abyss, for he has descended into it with all his power, and it will need a repentance proportioned to the measure of his iniquities to restore him to the favour of his God. There is evinced in this developement, great knowledge of the human heart, and a very striking revelation of the mysterious dealings of a just and compassionate God.

We find the same sagacity of observation in other parts of the work; it appears under an altogether original form in the episode of Gertrude; irresistibly conducted to the cloister, notwithstanding her insurmountable repugnance, when she could by a single word free herself from such a condemnation, dooming her own self to a sacrifice she detests; yielding without having been conquered; the slave of her very liberty, and the victim to a voluntary fatality! It is not in a rapid sketch that we can give an idea of this singular and altogether novel character. To appreciate its excellence, we must give an attentive perusal.

But Alessandro Manzoni is not only a skilful painter of individual portraits, he excels also in grand historical representations. In that of the plague at Milan, and the famine preceding it, his manner becomes bolder, his touch more free and majestic, without, however, losing any of its exquisite delicacy. When he represents an entire people rebelling against hunger, or vanquished by disease and death, we deeply feel the horror of the picture, at the same time that an occasional smile is elicited by the comic genius of the artist, which exercises itself even amidst the agonies of famine and pestilence, so that, through the grand design of the exhibition, the delicate touches of the pencil are still visible, and individual character perceptible through the very depths of bold and general description; it is Van Dyck painting on the reverse of one of Michael Angelo's pictures.

We will not take leave of this interesting production without indulging ourselves in one more observation, which is, that in this succession of adventures, where appear, by turns or simultaneously, two robber chiefs and their followers, an unbridled soldiery, a people in rebellion, famine, and pestilence, all the evil specially resulting to the virtuous, is the consequence of the cowardice of a single man! What a lesson may we derive from such a Novel!

 
 
THE BETROTHED.
CHAPTER I.

That branch of the Lake of Como, which turns toward the south between two unbroken chains of mountains, presenting to the eye a succession of bays and gulfs, formed by their jutting and retiring ridges, suddenly contracts itself between a headland to the right and an extended sloping bank on the left, and assumes the flow and appearance of a river. The bridge by which the two shores are here united, appears to render the transformation more apparent, and marks the point at which the lake ceases, and the Adda recommences, to resume, however, the name of Lake where the again receding banks allow the water to expand itself anew into bays and gulfs. The bank, formed by the deposit of three large mountain streams, descends from the bases of two contiguous mountains, the one called St. Martin, the other by a Lombard name, Resegone, from its long line of summits, which in truth give it the appearance of a saw; so that there is no one who would not at first sight, especially viewing it in front, from the ramparts of Milan that face the north, at once distinguish it in all that extensive range from other mountains of less name and more ordinary form. The bank, for a considerable distance, rises with a gentle and continual ascent, then breaks into hills and hollows, rugged or level land, according to the formation of the mountain rocks, and the action of the floods. Its extreme border, intersected by the mountain torrents, is composed almost entirely of sand and pebbles; the other parts of fields and vineyards, scattered farms, country seats, and villages, with here and there a wood which extends up the mountain side. Lecco, the largest of these villages, and which gives its name to the district, is situated at no great distance from the bridge, upon the margin of the lake; nay, often, at the rising of the waters, is partly embosomed within the lake itself; a large town at the present day, and likely soon to become a city. At the period of our story, this village was also fortified, and consequently had the honour to furnish quarters to a governor, and the advantage of possessing a permanent garrison of Spanish soldiers, who gave lessons in modesty to the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood, and toward the close of summer never failed to scatter themselves through the vineyards, in order to thin the grapes, and lighten for the rustics the labours of the vintage. From village to village, from the heights down to the margin of the lake, there are innumerable roads and paths: these vary in their character; at times precipitous, at others level; now sunk and buried between two ivy-clad walls, from whose depth you can behold nothing but the sky, or some lofty mountain peak; then crossing high and level tracts, around the edges of which they sometimes wind, occasionally projecting beyond the face of the mountain, supported by prominent masses resembling bastions, whence the eye wanders over the most varied and delicious landscape. On the one side you behold the blue lake, with its boundaries broken by various promontories and necks of land, and reflecting the inverted images of the objects on its banks; on the other, the Adda, which, flowing beneath the arches of the bridge, expands into a small lake, then contracts again, and holds on its clear serpentining course to the distant horizon: above, are the ponderous masses of the shapeless rocks; beneath, the richly cultivated acclivity, the fair landscape, the bridge; in front, the opposite shore of the lake, and beyond this, the mountain, which bounds the view.

Towards evening, on the 7th day of November, 1628, Don Abbondio, curate of one of the villages before alluded to (but of the name of which, nor of the house and lineage of its curate, we are not informed), was returning slowly towards his home, by one of these pathways. He was repeating quietly his office; in the pauses of which he held his closed breviary in his hand behind his back; and as he went, with his foot he cast listlessly against the wall the stones that happened to impede his path; at the same time giving admittance to the idle thoughts that tempted the spirit, while the lips of the worthy man were mechanically performing their function; then raising his head and gazing idly around him, he fixed his eyes upon a mountain summit, where the rays of the setting sun, breaking through the openings of an opposite ridge, illumined its projecting masses, which appeared like large and variously shaped spots of purple light. He then opened anew his breviary, and recited another portion at an angle of the lane, after which angle the road continued straight for perhaps seventy paces, and then branched like the letter Y into two narrow paths; the right-hand one ascended towards the mountain, and led to the parsonage (Cura); that on the left descended the valley towards a torrent, and on this side the wall rose out to the height of about two feet. The inner walls of the two narrow paths, instead of meeting at the angle, ended in a little chapel, upon which were depicted certain long, sinuous, pointed shapes, which, in the intention of the artist, and to the eyes of the neighbouring inhabitants, represented flames, and amidst these flames certain other forms, not to be described, that were meant for souls in purgatory; souls and flames of a brick colour, upon a ground of blackish grey, with here and there a bare spot of plaster. The curate, having turned the corner, directed, as was his wont, a look toward the little chapel, and there beheld what he little expected, and would not have desired to see. At the confluence, if we may so call it, of the two narrow lanes, there were two men: one of them sitting astride the low wall; his companion leaning against it, with his arms folded on his breast. The dress, the bearing, and what the curate could distinguish of the countenance of these men, left no doubt as to their profession. They wore upon their heads a green network, which, falling on the left shoulder, ended in a large tassel, from under which appeared upon the forehead an enormous lock of hair. Their mustachios were long, and curled at the extremities; the margin of their doublets confined by a belt of polished leather, from which were suspended, by hooks, two pistols; a little powder-horn hung like a locket on the breast; on the right-hand side of the wide and ample breeches was a pocket, out of which projected the handle of a knife, and on the other side they bore a long sword, of which the great hollow hilt was formed of bright plates of brass, combined into a cypher: by these characteristics they were, at a glance, recognised as individuals of the class of bravoes.

This species, now entirely extinct, flourished greatly at that time in Lombardy. For those who have no knowledge of it, the following are a few authentic records, that may suffice to impart an idea of its principal characteristics, of the vigorous efforts made to extirpate it, and of its obstinate and rank vitality.

As early as the 8th of April, 1583, the most illustrious and most excellent lord Don Charles of Arragon, Prince of Castelvetrano, Duke of Terranova, Marquis of Avola, Count of Burgeto, High Admiral and High Constable of Sicily, Governor of Milan, and Captain General of His Catholic Majesty in Italy, “fully informed of the intolerable misery which the city of Milan has endured, and still endures, by reason of bravoes and vagabonds,” publishes his decree against them, “declares and designates all those comprehended in this proclamation to be regarded as bravoes and vagabonds,——who, whether foreigners or natives, have no calling, or, having one, do not follow it,——but, either with or without wages, attach themselves to any knight, gentleman, officer, or merchant,——to uphold or favour him, or in any manner to molest others.” All such he commands, within the space of six days, to leave the country; threatens the refractory with the galleys, and grants to all officers of justice the most ample and unlimited powers for the execution of his commands. But, in the following year, on the 12th of April, the said lord, having perceived “that this city still continues to be filled with bravoes, who have again resumed their former mode of life; their manners unchanged, and their number undiminished,” puts forth another edict still more energetic and remarkable, in which, among other regulations, he directs “that any person whatsoever, whether of this city or from abroad, who shall, by the testimony of two witnesses, be shown to be regarded and commonly reputed as a bravo, even though no criminal act shall have been proved against him, may, nevertheless, upon the sole ground of his reputation, be condemned by the said judges to the rack for examination; and although he make no confession of guilt, he shall, notwithstanding, be sentenced to the galleys for the said term of three years, solely for that he is regarded as, and called a bravo, as above-mentioned;” and this “because His Excellency is resolved to enforce obedience to his commands.”

One would suppose that at the sound of such denunciations from so powerful a source, all the bravoes must have disappeared for ever. But testimony, of no less authority, obliges us to believe directly the reverse. This testimony is the most illustrious and most excellent lord Juan Fernandez de Velasco, Constable of Castile, High Chamberlain of His Majesty, Duke of the city of Freas, Count of Haro and Castelnuovo, Lord of the house of Velasco, and of that of the Seven Infanti of Lara, Governor of the State of Milan, &c. On the 5th of June, 1593, he also, fully informed “how great an injury to the common weal, and how insulting to justice, is the existence of such a class of men,” requires them anew to quit the country within six days, repeating very nearly the same threats and injunctions as his predecessor. On the 23d of May, then, 1598, “having learnt, with no little displeasure, that the number of bravoes and vagabonds is increasing daily in this state and city, and that nothing is heard of them but wounds, murders, robberies, and every other crime, to the commission of which these bravoes are encouraged by the confidence that they will be sustained by their chiefs and abettors,” he prescribes again the same remedies, increasing the dose, as is usual in obstinate disorders. “Let every one, then,” he concludes, “carefully beware that he do not, in any wise, contravene this edict; since, in place of experiencing the mercy of His Excellency, he shall prove his rigour and his wrath—he being resolved and determined that this shall be a final and peremptory warning.”

But this again did not suffice; and the illustrious and most excellent lord, the Signor Don Pietro Enriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes, Captain and Governor of the State of Milan, “fully informed of the wretched condition of this city and state, in consequence of the great number of bravoes that abound therein, and resolved wholly to extirpate them,” publishes, on the 5th of December, 1600, a new decree, full of the most rigorous provisions, and “with firm purpose that in all rigour, and without hope of remission, they shall be wholly carried into execution.”

We are obliged, however, to conclude that he did not, in this matter, exhibit the same zeal which he knew how to employ in contriving plots and exciting enemies against his powerful foe, Henry IV., against whom history attests that he succeeded in arming the Duke of Savoy, whom he caused to lose more towns than one; and in engaging in a conspiracy the Duke of Biron, whom he caused to lose his head. But as regards the pestilent race of bravoes, it is very certain they continued to increase until the 22d day of September, 1612; on which day the most illustrious and most excellent lord Don Giovanni de Mendoza, Marchese de la Hynojosa, gentleman, & c., Governor, & c., thought seriously of their extirpation. He addressed to Pandolfo and Marco Tullio Malatesti, printers of the Royal Chamber, the customary edict, corrected and enlarged, that they might print it, to accomplish that end. But the bravoes still survived, to experience, on the 24th December, 1618, still more terrific denunciations from the most illustrious and most excellent lord, Don Gomez Suarez de Figueroa, Duke of Feria, Governor, & c.; yet, as they did not fall even under these blows, the most illustrious and most excellent lord Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, under whose government we are made acquainted with Don Abbondio, found himself obliged to republish the usual proclamation against the bravoes, on the 5th day of October, 1627, that is, a year, a month, and two days previous to the commencement of our story.

Nor was this the last publication; but of those that follow, as of matters not falling within the period of our history, we do not think it proper to make mention. The only one of them to which we shall refer, is that of the 13th day of February, 1632, in which the most illustrious and most excellent lord, the Duke of Feria, for the second time governor, informs us, “that the greatest and most heinous crimes are perpetrated by those styled bravoes.” This will suffice to prove that, at the time of which we treat, the bravoes still existed.

It appeared evident to Don Abbondio that the two men above mentioned were waiting for some one, and he was alarmed at the conviction that it was for himself; for on his appearance, they exchanged a look, as if to say, “'tis he.” Rising from the wall, they both advanced to meet him. He held his breviary open before him, as though he were employed in reading it; but, nevertheless, cast a glance upward in order to espy their movements. Seeing that they came directly toward him, he was beset by a thousand different thoughts. He considered, in haste, whether between the bravoes and himself there were any outlet from the road, and he remembered there was none. He took a rapid survey of his conduct, to discover if he had given offence to any powerful or revengeful man; but in this matter, he was somewhat reassured by the consoling testimony of his conscience. The bravoes draw near, and kept their eyes upon him. He raised his hand to his collar, as if adjusting it, and at the same time turned his head round, to see if any one were coming; he could discover no one. He cast a glance across the low stone wall upon the fields; no one! another on the road that lay before him; no one, except the bravoes! What is to be done? Flight was impossible. Unable to avoid the danger, he hastened to encounter it, and to put an end to the torments of uncertainty. He quickened his pace, recited a stanza in a louder tone, did his utmost to assume a composed and cheerful countenance, and finding himself in front of the two gallants, stopped short. “Signor Curate,” said one of them, fixing his eyes upon him,—

“Your pleasure, sir,” suddenly raising his eyes from his book, which he continued to hold open before him.

“You intend,” pursued the other, with the threatening and angry mien of one who has detected an inferior in an attempt to commit some villany, “you intend to-morrow to unite in marriage Renzo Tramaglino and Lucy Mondella.”

“That is,” said Don Abbondio with a faltering voice, “that is to say—you gentlemen, being men of the world, are very well aware how these things are managed: the poor curate neither meddles nor makes—they settle their affairs amongst themselves, and then—then, they come to us, as if to redeem a pledge; and we—we are the servants of the public.”

“Mark now,” said the bravo in a low voice, but in a tone of command, “this marriage is not to take place, neither to-morrow, nor at any other time.”

“But, my good sirs,” replied Don Abbondio, with the mild and gentle tone of one who would persuade an impatient listener, “but, my good sirs, deign to put yourselves in my situation. If the thing depended on myself—you see plainly, that it does not in the least concern——”

“Hold there,” said the bravo, interrupting him, “this matter is not to be settled by prating. We neither know nor care to know any more about it. A man once warned—you understand us.”

“But, fair sirs, you are too just, too reasonable——”

“But,” interrupted the other comrade, who had not before spoken, “but this marriage is not to be performed, or (with an oath) he who performs it will not repent of it, because he'll not have time” (with another oath).

“Hush, hush,” resumed the first orator, “the Signor Curate knows the world, and we are gentlemen who have no wish to harm him if he conducts himself with judgment. Signor Curate, the most illustrious Signor Don Roderick, our patron, offers you his kind regards.” As in the height of a midnight storm a vivid flash casts a momentary dazzling glare around and renders every object more fearful, so did this name increase the terror of Don Abbondio: as if by instinct, he bowed his head submissively, and said—

“If it could but be suggested to me.”

“Oh! suggested to you, who understand Latin!” exclaimed the bravo, laughing; “it is for you to manage the matter. But, above all, be careful not to say a word concerning the hint that has been given you for your good; for if you do, ehem!—you understand—the consequences would be the same as if you performed the marriage ceremony. But say, what answer are we to carry in your name to the most illustrious Signor Don Roderick?”

“My respects——”

“Speak more clearly, Signor Curate.”

“That I am disposed, ever disposed, to obedience.” And as he spoke the words he was not very certain himself whether he gave a promise, or only uttered an ordinary compliment. The bravoes took, or appeared to take them, in the more serious sense.

“'Tis very well; good night, Signor Curate,” said one of them as he retired, together with his companion. Don Abbondio, who a few minutes before would have given one of his eyes to avoid the ruffians, was now desirous to prolong the conversation.

“Gentlemen——” he began, as he shut his book. Without again noticing him, however, they passed on, singing a loose song, of which we will not transcribe the words. Poor Don Abbondio remained for a moment, as if spell-bound, and then with heavy and lagging steps took the path which led towards his home. The reader will better understand the state of his mind, when he shall have learned something more of his disposition, and of the condition of the times in which it was his lot to live.

Don Abbondio was not (as the reader may have perceived) endowed with the courage of a lion. But from his earliest years he had been sensible that the most embarrassing situation in those times was that of an animal, furnished with neither tusks nor talons, at the same time having no wish to be devoured. The arm of the law afforded no protection to a man of quiet, inoffensive habits, who had no means of making himself feared. Not that laws and penalties were wanting for the prevention of private violence: the laws were most express; the offences enumerated, and minutely particularised; the penalties sufficiently extravagant; and if that were not enough, the legislator himself, and, a hundred others to whom was committed the execution of the laws, had power to increase them. The proceedings were studiously contrived to free the judge from every thing that might prevent his passing sentence of condemnation; the passages we have cited from proclamations against the bravoes, may be taken as a faithful specimen of these decrees. Notwithstanding this, or, it may be, in consequence of this, these proclamations, reiterated and reinforced from time to time, served only to proclaim in pompous language the impotence of those who issued them; or, if they produced any immediate effect, it was that of adding to the vexations which the peaceful and feeble suffered from the disturbers of society. Impunity was organised and effected in so many ways as to render the proclamations powerless. Such was the consequence of the sanctuaries and asylums; and of the privileges of certain classes, partly acknowledged by the legal power, partly tolerated in silence, or feebly opposed; but which, in fact, were sustained and guarded by almost every individual with interested activity and punctilious jealousy. Now this impunity, threatened and assailed, but not destroyed, by these proclamations, would naturally, at every new attack, employ fresh efforts and devices to maintain itself. The proclamations were efficient, it is true, in fettering and embarrassing the honest man, who had neither power in himself nor protection from others; inasmuch as, in order to reach every person, they subjected the movements of each private individual to the arbitrary will of a thousand magistrates and executive officers. But he, who before the commission of his crime had prepared himself a refuge in some convent or palace where bailiffs never dared to enter; or who simply wore a livery, which engaged in his defence the vanity or the interest of a powerful family; such a one was free in his actions, and could laugh to scorn every proclamation. Of those very persons whose part it was to ensure the execution of these decrees, some belonged by birth to the privileged class, others were its clients and dependants; and as the latter as well as the former had, from education, from habit, from imitation, embraced its maxims, they would be very careful not to violate them. Had they however, been bold as heroes, obedient as monks, and devoted as martyrs, they could never have accomplished the execution of the laws, inferior as they were in number to those with whom they must engage, and with the frequent probability of being abandoned, or even sacrificed, by him who, in a moment of theoretical abstraction, might require them to act. But, in addition to this, their office would be regarded as a base one in public opinion, and their name stamped with reproach. It was therefore very natural that, instead of risking, nay, throwing away, their lives in a fruitless attempt, they should sell their inaction, or, rather, their connivance, to the powerful; or, at least, exercise their authority only on those occasions when it might be done with safety to themselves; that is, in oppressing the peaceable and the defenceless.

The man who acts with violence, or who is constantly in fear of violence from others, seeks companions and allies. Hence it happened that, during these times, individuals displayed so strong a tendency to combine themselves into classes, and to advance, as far as each one was able, the power of that to which he belonged. The clergy was vigilant in the defence and extension of its immunities; the nobility, of its privileges; the military, of its exemptions; the merchants and artisans were enrolled in companies and fraternities; the lawyers were united in leagues, and even the physicians formed a corporation. Each of these little oligarchies had its own appropriate power,—in each of them the individual found the advantage of employing for himself, in proportion to his influence and dexterity, the united force of numbers. The more honest availed themselves of this advantage merely for their defence; the crafty and the wicked profited by it to assure themselves of success in their rogueries, and impunity from their results. The strength, however, of these various combinations was far from being equal; and, especially in the country, the wealthy and overbearing nobleman, with a band of bravoes, and surrounded by peasants accustomed to regard themselves as subjects and soldiers of their lord, exercised an irresistible power, and set all laws at defiance.

Don Abbondio, neither noble, rich, nor valiant, had from early youth found himself alone and unaided in such a state of society, like an earthen vessel thrown amidst iron jars; he therefore readily obeyed his parents, who wished him to become a priest. He did, to say the truth, not regard the obligations and the noble ends of the ministry to which he dedicated himself, but was only desirous to secure the means of living, and to connect himself with a powerful and respected class. But no class provided for the individual, or secured his safety, further than to a certain point; none rendered it unnecessary for him to adopt for himself a system of his own. The system of Don Abbondio consisted chiefly in shunning all disputes; he maintained an unarmed neutrality in all the contests that broke out around him;—between the clergy and the civil power, between persons in office and nobles and magistrates, bravoes and soldiers, down to the squabbles of the peasantry themselves, terminated by the fist or the knife. By keeping aloof from the overbearing, by affecting not to notice their acts of violence, by bowing low and with the most profound respect to all whom he met, the poor man had succeeded in passing over sixty years without encountering any violent storms; not but that he also had some small portion of gall in his composition; and this continual exercise of patience exacerbated it to such a degree, that, if he had not had it in his power occasionally to give it vent, his health must have suffered. But as there were a few persons in the world connected with himself whom he knew to be powerless, he could, from time to time, discharge on them his long pent-up ill-humour. He was, moreover, a severe censor of those who did not regulate their conduct by his example, provided he could censure without danger. According to his creed, the poor fellow who had been cudgelled had been a little imprudent; the murdered man had always been turbulent; the man who maintained his right against the powerful, and met with a broken head, must have been somewhat wrong; which is, perhaps, true enough, for in all disputes the line can never be drawn so finely as not to leave a little wrong on both sides. He especially declaimed against those of his confraternity, who, at their own risk, took part with the oppressed against a powerful oppressor. “This,” he said, “was to purchase trouble with ready money, to kick at snarling dogs, and an intermeddling in profane things that lowered the dignity of the sacred ministry.” He had, in short, a favourite maxim, that an honest man, who looked to himself and minded his own affairs, never met with any rough encounters.

From all that has been said, we may imagine the effect the meeting just described must have had upon the mind of poor Don Abbondio. Those fierce countenances, the threats of a lord who was well known not to speak idly, his plan of quiet life and patient endurance disconcerted in an instant, a difficulty before him from which he saw no possibility of extrication; all these thoughts rushed confusedly through his mind. “If Renzo could be quietly dismissed with a refusal, all would be well; but he will require reasons—and what can I say to him? he too has a head of his own; a lamb, if not meddled with—but once attempt to cross him——  Oh!—and raving after that Lucy, as much enamoured as——  Young idiots! who, for want of something else to do, fall in love, and must be married, forsooth, thinking of nothing else, never concerning themselves about the trouble they bring upon an honest man like me. Wretch that I am! Why should those two scowling faces plant themselves exactly in my path, and pick a quarrel with me? What have I to do in the matter? Is it I that mean to wive? Why did they not rather go and speak——  Ah! truly, that which is to the purpose always occurs to me after the right time: if I had but thought of suggesting to them to go and bear their message——” But here he was disturbed by the reflection, that to repent of not having been the counsellor and abettor of evil, was too iniquitous a thing; and he therefore turned the rancour of his thoughts against the individual who had thus robbed him of his tranquillity. He did not know Don Roderick, except by sight and by report; his sole intercourse with him had been to touch chin to breast, and the ground with the corner of his hat, the few times he had met him on the road. He had, on more than one occasion, defended the reputation of that Signor against those who, in an under-tone, with sighs and looks raised to heaven, had execrated some one of his exploits. He had declared a hundred times that he was a respectable cavalier. But at this moment he, in his own heart, readily bestowed upon him all those titles to which he would never lend an ear from another. Having, amidst the tumult of these thoughts, reached the entrance of his house, which stood at the end of the little glebe, he unlocked the door, entered, and carefully secured it within. Anxious to find himself in society that he could trust, he called aloud, “Perpetua, Perpetua,” advancing towards the little parlour where she was, doubtless, employed in preparing the table for his supper. Perpetua was, as the reader must be aware, the housekeeper of Don Abbondio; an affectionate and faithful domestic, who knew how to obey or command as occasion served; to bear the grumbling and whims of her master at times, and at others to make him bear with hers. These were becoming every day more frequent; she had passed the age of forty in a single state; the consequences, she said, of having refused all the offers that had been made her; her female friends asserted that she had never found any one willing to take her.

“Coming,” said Perpetua, as she set in its usual place on the little table the flask of Don Abbondio's favourite wine, and moved slowly toward the parlour door: before she reached it he entered, with steps so disordered, looks so clouded, and a countenance so changed, that an eye less practised than that of Perpetua could have discovered at a glance that something unusual had befallen him.

“Mercy on me! What is it ails my master?”

“Nothing, nothing,” said Don Abbondio, as he sank upon his easy chair.

“How, nothing! Would you have me believe that, looking as you do? Some dreadful accident has happened.”

“Oh! for the love of Heaven! When I say nothing, it is either nothing, or something I cannot tell.”

“That you cannot tell, not even to me? Who will take care of your health? Who will give you advice?”

“Oh! peace, peace! Do not make matters worse. Give me a glass of my wine.”

“And you will still pretend to me that nothing is the matter?” said Perpetua, filling the glass, but retaining it in her hand, as if unwilling to present it except as the reward of confidence.

“Give here, give here,” said Don Abbondio, taking the glass with an unsteady hand, and hastily swallowing its contents.

“Would you oblige me then to go about, asking here and there what it is has happened to my master?” said Perpetua, standing upright before him, with her hands on her sides, and looking him steadfastly in the face, as if to extract the secret from his eyes.

“For the love of Heaven, do not worry me, do not kill me with your pother; this is a matter that concerns—concerns my life.”

“Your life!”

“My life.”

“You know well, that, when you have frankly confided in me, I have never——”

“Yes, forsooth, as when——”

Perpetua was sensible she had touched a false string; wherefore, changing suddenly her note, “My dear master,” said she, in a moving tone of voice, “I have always had a dutiful regard for you, and if I now wish to know this affair, it is from zeal, and a desire to assist you, to give you advice, to relieve your mind.”

The truth is, that Don Abbondio's desire to disburden himself of his painful secret was as great as that of Perpetua to obtain a knowledge of it; so that, after having repulsed, more and more feebly, her renewed assaults; after having made her swear many times that she would not breathe a syllable of it, he, with frequent pauses and exclamations, related his miserable adventure. When it was necessary to pronounce the dread name of him from whom the prohibition came, he required from Perpetua another and more solemn oath: having uttered it, he threw himself back on his seat with a heavy sigh, and, in a tone of command, as well as supplication, exclaimed,—

“For the love of Heaven!”—

“Mercy upon me!” cried Perpetua, “what a wretch! what a tyrant! Does he not fear God?”

“Will you be silent? or do you want to ruin me completely?”

“Oh! we are here alone, no one can hear us. But what will my poor master do?”

“See there now,” said Don Abbondio, in a peevish tone, “see the fine advice you give me. To ask of me, what I'll do? what I'll do? as if you were the one in difficulty, and it was for me to help you out!”

“Nay, I could give you my own poor opinion; but then—”

“But—but then, let us know it.”

“My opinion would be, that, as every one says our archbishop is a saint, a man of courage, and not to be frightened by an ugly phiz, and who will take pleasure in upholding a curate against one of these tyrants; I should say, and do say, that you had better write him a handsome letter, to inform him as how——”

“Will you be silent! will you be silent! Is this advice to offer a poor man? When I get a pistol bullet in my side—God preserve me!—will the archbishop take it out?”

“Ah! pistol bullets are not given away like sugarplums; and it were woful if those dogs should bite every time they bark. If a man knows how to show his teeth, and make himself feared, they hold him in respect: we should not have been brought to such a pass, if you had stood upon your rights. Now, all come to us (by your good leave) to——”

“Will you be silent?”

“Certainly; but it is true though, that when the world sees one is always ready, in every encounter, to lower——”

“Will you be silent? Is this a time for such idle talk?”

“Well, well, you'll think of it to-night; but in the meantime do not be the first to harm yourself; to destroy your own health: eat a mouthful.”

“I'll think of it,” murmured Don Abbondio; “certainly I'll think of it. I must think of it;” and he arose, continuing—“No! I'll take nothing, nothing; I've something else to do. But, that this should have fallen upon me——”

“Swallow at least this other little drop,” said Perpetua, as she poured the wine. “You know it always restores your stomach.”

“Oh! there wants other medicine than that, other medicine than that, other medicine than that——”

So saying, he took the light, and muttering, “A pretty business this! To an honest man like me! And to-morrow, what is to be done?” with other like exclamations, he went towards his bedchamber. Having reached the door, he stopped a moment, and before he quitted the room, exclaimed, turning towards Perpetua, with his finger on his lips—“For the love of Heaven, be silent!”
CHAPTER II.

It is related that the Prince of Condé slept soundly the night preceding the battle of Rocroi; but then, he was greatly fatigued, and moreover had made every arrangement for the morrow. It was not thus with Don Abbondio; he only knew the morrow would be a day of trouble, and consequently passed the night in anxious anticipation. He could not for a moment think of disregarding the menaces of the bravoes, and solemnising the marriage. To confide to Renzo the occurrence, and consult with him as to the means—God forbid!—He remembered the warning of the bravo, “not to say one word”—otherwise, ahem! and this dreadful ahem of the bravo resounded in the ears of Don Abbondio; so that he already repented of his communication to Perpetua. To fly was impossible—and where could he fly? At the thought, a thousand obstacles presented themselves.—After long and painful deliberation, he resolved to endeavour to gain time, by giving Renzo some fanciful reasons for the postponement of the marriage. He recollected that in a few days more the time would arrive, during which marriages were prohibited. “And if I can keep this youngster at bay for a few days, I shall then have two months before me; and in two months who can tell what may happen?” He thought of various pretexts for his purpose; and though they were rather flimsy, he persuaded himself that his authority would give them weight, and that his experience would prevail over the mind of an ignorant youth. “We will see,” said he to himself: “he thinks of his love, but I think of myself; I am, therefore, the party most interested; I must call in all my cunning to assist me. I cannot help it, young man, if you suffer; I must not be the victim.” Having somewhat composed his mind with this determination, he at length fell asleep. But his dreams, alas! how horrible—bravoes, Don Roderick, Renzo, roads, rocks, cries, bullets.

The arousing from sleep, after a recent misfortune, is a bitter moment; the mind at first habitually recurs to its previous tranquillity, but is soon depressed by the thought of the contrast that awaits it. When alive to a sense of his situation, Don Abbondio recapitulated the plans of the night, made a better disposal of them, and after having risen, awaited with dread and impatience the moment of Renzo's arrival.

Lorenzo, or as he was called, Renzo, did not make him wait long; at an early hour he presented himself before the curate with the joyful readiness of one who was on this day to espouse her whom he loved. He had been deprived of his parents in his youth, and now practised the trade of a weaver of silk, which was, it might be said, hereditary in his family. This trade had once been very lucrative; and although now on the decline, a skilful workman might obtain from it a respectable livelihood. The continual emigration of the tradesmen, attracted to the neighbouring states by promises and privileges, left sufficient employment for those who remained behind. Besides, Renzo possessed a small farm, which he had cultivated himself when otherwise unoccupied; so that, for one of his condition, he might be called wealthy: and although the last harvest had been more deficient than the preceding ones, and the evils of famine were beginning to be felt; yet, from the moment he had given his heart to Lucy, he had been so economical as to preserve a sufficiency of all necessaries, and to be in no danger of wanting bread. He appeared before Don Abbondio gaily dressed, and with a joyful countenance. The mysterious and perplexed manner of the curate formed a singular contrast to that of the handsome young man.

“What is the matter now?” thought Renzo; but without waiting to answer his own question, “Signor Curate,” said he, “I am come to know at what hour of the day it will be convenient for you that we should be at the church?”

“Of what day do you speak?”

“How! of what day? do you not remember that this is the day appointed?”

“To-day?” replied Don Abbondio, as if he heard it for the first time, “to-day? to-day? be patient, I cannot to-day——”

“You cannot to-day? why not?”

“In the first place I am not well——”

“I am sorry for it; but we shall not detain you long, and you will not be much fatigued.”

“But then—but then——”

“But then, what, sir?”

“There are difficulties.”

“Difficulties! How can that be?”

“People should be in our situation, to know how many obstacles there are to these matters; I am too yielding, I think only of removing impediments, of rendering all things easy, and promoting the happiness of others. To do this I neglect my duty, and am covered with reproaches for it.”

“In the name of Heaven, keep me not thus in suspense, but tell me at once what is the matter?”

“Do you know how many formalities are required before the marriage can be celebrated?”

“I must, indeed, know something of them,” said Renzo, beginning to grow angry, “since you have racked my brains with them abundantly these few days back. But are not all things now ready? have you not done all there was to do?”

“All, all, you expect; but be patient, I tell you. I have been a blockhead to neglect my duty, that I might not cause pain to others;—we poor curates—we are, as may be said, ever between a hawk and a buzzard. I pity you, poor young man! I perceive your impatience, but my superiors——Enough, I have reasons for what I say, but I cannot tell all—we, however, are sure to suffer.”

“But tell me what this other formality is, and I will perform it immediately.”

“Do you know how many obstacles stand in the way?”

“How can I know any thing of obstacles?”

“Error, conditio, votum, cognatis, crimen, cultus disparitas, vis, ordo.... Si sit affinis....”

“Oh! for Heaven's sake—how should I understand all this Latin?”

“Be patient, dear Renzo; I am ready to do——all that depends on me. I—I wish to see you satisfied—I wish you well——  And when I think that you were so happy, that you wanted nothing when the whim entered your head to be married——”

“What words are these, Signor?” interrupted Renzo, with a look of astonishment and anger.

“I say, do be patient—I say, I wish to see you happy. In short—in short, my dear child, I have not been in fault; I did not make the laws. Before concluding a marriage, we are required to search closely that there be no obstacles.”

“Now, I beseech you, tell me at once what difficulty has occurred?”

“Be patient—these are not points to be cleared up in an instant. There will be nothing, I hope; but whether or not, we must search into the matter. The passage is clear and explicit,—‘antiquam matrimonium denunciet——’”

“I'll not hear your Latin.”

“But it is necessary to explain to you——”

“But why not do this before? Why tell me all was prepared? Why wait——”

“See there now! to reproach me with my kindness! I have hastened every thing to serve you; but—but there has occurred——well, well, I know——”

“And what do you wish that I should do?”

“Be patient for a few days. My dear child, a few days are not eternity; be patient.”

“For how long a time then?”

“We are coming to a good conclusion,” thought Don Abbondio. “Come,” said he, gently, “in fifteen days I will endeavour——”

“Fifteen days! Oh! this is something new. To tell me now, on the very day you yourself appointed for my marriage, that I must wait fifteen days! Fifteen,” resumed he, with a low and angry voice.

Don Abbondio interrupted him, earnestly seizing his hand, and with an imploring tone beseeching him to be quiet. “Come, come, don't be angry; for the love of Heaven! I'll see, I'll see if in a week——”

“And what shall I say to Lucy?” said Renzo, softening.

“That it has been a mistake of mine.”

“And to the world?”

“Say also it is my fault; that through too great haste I have made some great blunder: throw all the blame on me. Can I do more than this? Come in a week.”

“And then there will be no further difficulties?”

“When I say a thing——”

“Well, well, I will be quiet for a week; but be assured, I will be put off with no further excuses:—for the present, I take my leave.” So saying, he departed, making a bow to Don Abbondio less profound than usual, and giving him a look more expressive than respectful.

With a heavy heart he approached the house of his betrothed, his mind dwelling on the strange conversation which had just taken place. The cold and embarrassed reception of Don Abbondio, his constrained and impatient air, his mysterious hints, all combined to convince him there was still something he had not been willing to communicate. He stopped for a moment, debating with himself whether he should not return and compel him to be more frank; raising his eyes, however, he beheld Perpetua entering a little garden a few steps distant from the house. He called to her, quickened his pace, and detaining her at the gate, endeavoured to enter into discourse with her.

“Good day, Perpetua; I expected to have received your congratulations to-day.”

“But it must be as God pleases, my poor Renzo.”

“I want to ask a favour of you: the Signor Curate has offered reasons I cannot comprehend; will you explain to me the true cause why he is unable or unwilling to marry us to-day?”

“Oh! you think then that I know the secrets of my master.”

“I was right in supposing there was a mystery,” thought Renzo. “Come, come, Perpetua,” continued he, “we are friends; tell me what you know,—help a poor young man.”

“It is a bad thing to be born poor, my dear Renzo.”

“That is true,” replied he, still more confirmed in his suspicions—“that is true; but it is not becoming in the clergy to behave unjustly to the poor.”

“Hear me, Renzo; I can tell you nothing, because—I know nothing. But I can assure you my master would not wrong you or any one; and he is not to blame.”

“Who then is to blame?” asked Renzo, carelessly, but listening intently for a reply.

“I have told you already I know nothing. But I may be allowed to speak in defence of my master; poor man! if he has erred, it has been through too great kindness. There are in this world men who are overpowerful, knavish, and who fear not God.”

“Overpowerful! knavish!” thought Renzo; “these cannot be his superiors.”—“Come,” said he, with difficulty concealing his increasing agitation, “come, tell me who it is.”

“Ah! you would persuade me to speak, and I must not, because—I know nothing. I will keep silence as faithfully as if I had promised to do so. You might put me to the torture, and you could not draw any thing from me. Adieu! it is lost time for both of us.”

Thus saying, she re-entered the garden hastily, and shut the gate. Renzo turned very softly, lest at the noise of his footsteps she might discern the road he took: when fairly beyond her hearing, he quickened his steps, and in a moment was at the door of Don Abbondio's house; he entered, rushed towards the little parlour where he had left him, and finding him still there, approached him with a bold and furious manner.

“Eh! eh! what has happened now?” said Don Abbondio.

“Who is this powerful personage?” said Renzo, with the air of one resolved to obtain an explicit answer; “who is he that forbids me to marry Lucy?”

“What! what! what!” stammered Don Abbondio, turning pale with surprise. He arose from his chair, and made an effort to reach the door. But Renzo, who expected this movement, was upon his guard; and locking the door, he put the key in his pocket.

“Ah! will you speak now, Signor Curate? Every one knows the affair but myself; and, by heavens! I'll know it too. Who is it, I say?”

“Renzo, Renzo, for the love of charity, take care what you do; think of your soul.”

“I must know it at once—this moment.” So saying, he placed his hand on his dagger, but perhaps without intending it.

“Mercy!” exclaimed Don Abbondio, in a stifled voice.

“I must know it.”

“Who has told you?”

“Come, no more excuses. Speak plainly and quickly.”

“Do you mean to kill me?”

“I mean to know that which I have a right to know.”

“But if I speak, I die. Must I not preserve my life?”

“Speak, then.”

The manner of Renzo was so threatening and decided, that Don Abbondio felt there was no possibility of disobeying him. “Promise me—swear,” said he, “never to tell——”

“Tell me, tell me quickly his name, or——”

At this new adjuration, the poor curate, with the trembling look of a man who feels the instrument of the dentist in his mouth, feebly articulated, “Don——”

“Don?” replied Renzo, inclining his ear towards him, eager to hear the rest. “Don?”

“Don Roderick!” muttered he hastily, trembling at the sound that escaped his lips.

“Ah! dog!” shouted Renzo; “and how has he done it? what has he said to you to——”

“What? what?” said Don Abbondio, in an almost contemptuous tone, already gaining confidence by the sacrifice he had made. “I wish you were like myself, you would then meddle with nothing, and certainly you would not have had so many whims in your head.” He, however, related in terrible colours the ugly encounter; his anger, which had hitherto been subdued by fear, displayed itself as he proceeded; and perceiving that Renzo, between rage and astonishment, remained motionless, with his head bent down, he continued in a lively manner, “You have made a pretty business of it, indeed! You have rendered me a notable service. Thus to attack an honest man, your curate, in his own house! in a sacred place! You have done a fine thing, truly. To wrest from my mouth, that which I concealed, from prudence, for your own good. And now that you know it, what will you do? When I gave you good advice this morning, I had judgment for you and me; but believe me, this is no jesting matter, no question of right or wrong, but superior power. At all events, open the door; give me the key.”

“I may have been to blame,” replied Renzo with a softened voice, but in which might be perceived smothered anger towards his concealed enemy, “I may have been to blame, but if you had been in my situation——” He drew the key from his pocket, and advanced towards the door.

“Swear to me,” said Don Abbondio with a serious and anxious face.

“I may have been to blame—forgive me,” replied Renzo, moving to depart.

“Swear first,” said Don Abbondio, holding him tremblingly by the arm.

“I may have been to blame,” said Renzo, freeing himself from his grasp, and immediately springing out of the room.

“Perpetua! Perpetua!” cried Don Abbondio, after having in vain called back the fugitive. Perpetua did not answer. The poor man was so overwhelmed by his innumerable difficulties, his increasing perplexities, and so apprehensive of some fresh attack, that he conceived the idea of securing to himself a safe retreat from them all, by going to bed and giving out that he had a fever. His malady, indeed, was not altogether imaginary; the terror of the past day, the anxious watching of the night, the dread of the future, had combined to produce really the effect. Weary and stupified, he slumbered in his large chair, muttering occasionally in a feeble but passionate voice, “Perpetua.”—Perpetua arrived at last with a great cabbage under her arm, and with as unconcerned a countenance as if nothing had happened. We will spare the reader the reproaches, the accusations, and denials that passed between them; it is sufficient that Don Abbondio ordered Perpetua to bolt the door, not to put her foot outside, and if any one knocked, to reply from the window that the curate was gone to bed with a fever. He then slowly ascended the stairs and put himself really in bed, where we will leave him.

Renzo, meanwhile, with hurried steps, and with a mind unsettled and distracted as to the course he should pursue, approached his home. Those who injure others are guilty, not only of the evils they commit, but also of the effects produced by these evils on the characters of the injured persons. Renzo was a quiet and peaceful youth, but now his nature appeared changed, and his thoughts dwelt only on deeds of violence. He would have run to the house of Don Roderick to assault him there; but he remembered that it was a fortress, furnished with bravoes within, and well guarded without; that only those known to be friends and servants could enter without the minutest scrutiny; and that not even a tradesman could be seen there without being examined from head to foot; and he, above all, would be, alas! but too well known. He then imagined himself placed behind a hedge, with his arquebuss in his hand, waiting till Roderick should pass by alone; rejoicing internally at the thought, he pictured to himself an approaching footstep; the villain appears, he takes aim, fires, and he falls; he exults a moment over his dying struggles, and then escapes for his life beyond the confines! And Lucy? This name recalled his wiser and better thoughts: he remembered the last instructions of his parents; he thought of God, the Holy Virgin, and the Saints; and he tremblingly rejoiced that he had been guilty of the deed only in imagination. But how many hopes, promises, and anticipations did the idea of Lucy suggest? And this day so ardently desired! How announce to her the dreadful news? And then, what plan to pursue? How make her his own in spite of the power of this wicked lord? And now a tormenting suspicion passed through his mind. Don Roderick must have been instigated to this injury by a brutal passion for Lucy! And she! He could not for a moment endure the maddening thought that she had given him the slightest encouragement. But was she not informed of his designs? Could he have conceived his infamous purpose, and have advanced so far towards its completion, without her knowledge? And Lucy, his own beloved, had never uttered a syllable to him concerning it!

These reflections prevailing in his mind, he passed by his own house, which was situated in the centre of the village, and arrived at that of Lucy, which was at the opposite extremity. It had a small court-yard in front, which separated it from the road, and which was encircled by a low wall. Entering the yard, Renzo heard a confused murmur of voices in the upper chamber; he rightly supposed it to be the wedding company, and he could not resolve to appear before them with such a countenance. A little girl, who was standing at the door, ran towards him, crying out, “The bridegroom! the bridegroom!” “Hush, Betsy, hush,” said Renzo, “come hither; go to Lucy, and whisper in her ear—but let no one hear you—whisper in her ear, that I wish to speak with her in the lower chamber, and that she must come at once.” The little girl hastily ascended the stairs, proud of having a secret commission to execute. Lucy had just come forth, adorned from the hands of her mother, and surrounded by her admiring friends. These were playfully endeavouring to steal a look at the blooming bride; while she, with the timidity of rustic modesty, attempted to conceal her blushing countenance with her bending arm, from beneath which a smiling mouth nevertheless appeared. Her black tresses, parted on her white forehead, were folded up in multiplied circles on the back of her head, and fastened with pins of silver, projecting on every side like the rays of the sun: this is still the custom of the Milanese peasantry. Around her throat she had a necklace of garnets, alternated with beads of gold filagree; she wore a boddice embroidered in flowers, the sleeves tied with ribands; a short petticoat of silk, with numerous minute plaits; crimson stockings, and embroidered silk slippers. But beyond all these ornaments was the modest and beautiful joy depicted on her countenance; a joy, however, troubled by a slight shade of anxiety. The little Betsy intruded herself into the circle, managed to approach Lucy, and communicated her message. “I shall return in a moment,” said Lucy to her friends, as she hastily quitted the room. On perceiving the altered and unquiet appearance of Renzo, “What is the matter?” said she, not without a presentiment of evil.

“Lucy,” replied Renzo, “all is at a stand, and God knows whether we shall ever be man and wife!”

“How!” said Lucy, alarmed. Renzo related briefly the history of the morning; she listened with anguish: when he uttered the name of Don Roderick, “Ah!” exclaimed she, blushing and trembling, “has it then come to this?”

“Then you knew!” said Renzo.

“Too well,” replied Lucy.

“What did you know?”

“Do not make me speak now, do not make me weep! I'll call my mother and dismiss the company. We must be alone.”

As she departed, Renzo whispered, “And you have never spoken of it to me!”

“Ah, Renzo!” replied Lucy, turning for a moment to gaze at him.

He understood well what this action meant; it was as if she had said, “Can you doubt me?”

Meanwhile the good Agnes (so the mother of Lucy was called) had descended the stairs, to ascertain the cause of her daughter's disappearance. She remained with Renzo; while Lucy returned to the company, and, assuming all the composure she could, said to them, “The Signor Curate is indisposed, and the wedding cannot take place to-day.” The ladies departed, and lost no time in relating amongst the gossips of the neighbourhood all that had occurred, while they made particular enquiries respecting the reality of Don Abbondio's sickness. The truth of this cut short the conjectures which they had already begun to intimate by brief and mysterious hints.
CHAPTER III.

Lucy entered the lower room as Renzo was sorrowfully informing Agnes of that, to which she as sorrowfully listened. Both turned towards her from whom they expected an explanation which could not but be painful; the suspicions of both were, however, excited in the midst of their grief, and the displeasure they felt towards Lucy differed only according to their relative situation. Agnes, although anxious to hear her daughter speak, could not avoid reproaching her—“To say nothing to thy mother!”

“Now, I will tell you all,” said Lucy, wiping her eyes with her apron.

“Speak, speak!” cried at once her mother and her lover.

“Holy Virgin!” exclaimed Lucy, “that it should come to this!”—and with a voice interrupted by tears, she related that a few days previously, as she returned from weaving, and was loitering behind her companions, Don Roderick came up with her, in company with another gentleman; that the former sought to engage her in idle conversation; that she quickened her pace, without lending him an ear, and rejoined her companions; in the mean while she heard the other gentleman laugh, and Don Roderick say, “I'll lay a wager with you.” The day following, on their return, they met them again, but Lucy kept in the midst of her companions, with her head down; the other gentleman burst into laughter, and Don Roderick said, “We will see, we will see.” “Happily for me,” continued Lucy, “this day was the last of the weaving. I related the adventure immediately——”

“To whom didst thou relate it?” asked Agnes quickly, indignant at the idea of any one being preferred before her as a confidant.

“To Father Christopher, in confession, mamma,” replied Lucy, in a tone of apology. “I told him all, the last time you and I went to the church of the convent; you may perhaps recollect my contrivances for delay on that morning, until there should pass some villagers in whose company we might go into the street; because I was so afraid——”

The indignation of Agnes subsided at once, at the mention of a name so revered as Father Christopher's. “Thou didst well, my child,” said she; “but why not tell it also to thy mother?”

For this, Lucy had had two very good reasons; the one, a desire not to disturb and frighten her mother with a circumstance she could not have prevented; the other, the dread of placing a secret, which she wished to be buried in her own bosom in danger of becoming known to all the village: of these two reasons she only alleged the first.

“And could I,” said she, turning to Renzo, in a gentle and reproachful voice, “could I speak to you of this?—Alas! that you should know it now!”

“And what did the Father say to you?” asked Agnes.

“He told me to endeavour to hasten my nuptials, and in the mean while to keep myself within doors; to pray much to God; and he hoped that if Don Roderick should not see me, he would cease to think of me. And it was then,” continued she, turning again towards Renzo, without, however, raising her eyes, and blushing deeply, “it was then that I compelled myself, at the risk of appearing very forward, to request you to conclude the marriage before the appointed time. Who can tell what you must have thought of me? But I did it for the best, and from advice—and this morning I little thought——” She could articulate no longer, and burst into a flood of tears.

“Ah! the scoundrel! the villain!” exclaimed Renzo, pacing the room in a violent paroxysm of rage. He stopped suddenly before Lucy, regarded her with a countenance agitated by various passions, and said, “This is the last wicked deed this wretch will perform.”

“Ah! no, Renzo, for the love of Heaven!” cried Lucy; “no, no, for the love of Heaven! There is a God who watches over the oppressed; but do you think he will protect us if we do evil?”

“No, no, for the love of Heaven!” repeated Agnes.

“Renzo,” said Lucy, with a more resolved and tranquil air, “you have a trade, and I know how to work: let us go away into some distant place, that he may hear of us no more.”

“Ah, Lucy! but we are not yet man and wife! If we were married, then, indeed——” Lucy relapsed into tears, and all three remained silent; the deep despondency of their countenances formed a mournful contrast to the festive character of their dress.

“Hear me, my children; listen to me,” said Agnes, after a few moments; “I came into the world before you, and I know it a little better than you do. The devil is not so frightful as they paint him. To us poor people the skeins appear more entangled, because we do not know where to look for the end; but sometimes advice from a learned man——I know what I mean to say.—Do as I tell you, Renzo; go to Lecco; find the Doctor Azzecca Garbugli[2]; relate to him——But you must not call him by this name—it is a nick-name. Say to the doctor——what do they call him? Oh dear! I can't think of his real name, every one calls him Azzecca Garbugli. Well, well, find this tall, stiff, bald doctor, with a red nose, and a face as red——”

“I know the man by sight,” said Renzo.

“Well, very well,” continued Agnes, “there's a man for you! I have seen more than one troubled wretch who did not know which way to turn himself; I have known him remain an hour with the Doctor Azzecca Garbugli (be careful you don't call him so), and go away laughing at himself for his uneasiness. Take with you these fowls; I expected to have wrung their necks, poor little things! for the banquet of to-night; however, carry them to him, because one must never go empty-handed to these gentlemen. Relate to him all that has happened, and he will tell you at once that which would never enter our heads in a year.”

Renzo and Lucy approved of this advice; Agnes, proud of having given it, with great complacency took the poor fowls one by one from the coop, tied their legs together as if she were making a nosegay, and consigned them to his hands. After having exchanged words of hope, he departed, avoiding the high road and crossing the fields, so as not to attract notice. As he went along, he had leisure to dwell on his misfortunes, and revolve in his mind his anticipated interview with the Doctor Azzecca Garbugli. I leave the reader to imagine the condition of the unfortunate fowls swinging by the legs with their heads downwards in the hands of a man agitated by all the tumults of passion; and whose arm moved more in accordance with the violence of his feelings, than with sympathy for the unhappy animals whose heads became conscious of sundry terrific shocks, which they resented by pecking at one another,—a practice too frequent with companions in misfortune.

He arrived at the village, asked for the house of the doctor, which being pointed out to him, he proceeded thither. On entering, he experienced the timidity so common to the poor and illiterate at the near approach to the learned and noble; he forgot all the speeches he had prepared, but giving a glance at the fowls, he took courage. He entered the kitchen, and demanded of the maid servant, “If he could speak with the Signor Doctor?” As if accustomed to similar gifts, she immediately took the fowls out of his hand, although Renzo drew them back, wishing the doctor to know that it was he who brought them. The doctor entered as the maid was saying, “Give here, and pass into the study.” Renzo bowed low to him; he replied with a kind “Come in, my son,” and led the way into an adjoining chamber. This was a large room, on the three walls of which were distributed portraits of the twelve Cæsars, while the fourth was covered with a large bookcase of old and dusty books; in the middle stood a table laden with memorials, libels, and proclamations, with three or four seats around; on one side of it was a large arm-chair with a high and square back, terminated at each corner by ornaments of wood in the fashion of horns; the nails which had fallen out here and there from its leathern covering, left the corners of it at liberty to roll themselves up in all directions. The doctor was in his morning gown, that is, enveloped in a faded toga, which had served him long since to appear in at Milan, on some great occasion. He closed the door, and encouraged the young man with these words: “My son, tell me your case.”

“I wish to speak a word to you in confidence.”

“Well, say on,” replied the doctor, as he seated himself in the arm-chair. Renzo stood before the table twirling his hat in his hand, and began, “I wish to know from one as learned as yourself——”

“Tell me the affair just as it is,” interrupted the doctor, “in as few words as possible.”

“You must pardon me, Signor Doctor; we poor people know not how to speak to such as you are. I wish then to know——”

“Bless the people! they are all alike; instead of relating facts, they ask questions; and that because their own opinions are already settled!”

“Excuse me, Signor Doctor. I wish, then, to know if there is a punishment for threatening a curate, to prevent him from performing a marriage ceremony?”

“I understand,” said the doctor, who in truth had not understood—“I understand.” And suddenly assuming an air of seriousness and importance, “A serious case, my son—a case contemplated. You have done well to come to me; it is a clear case, noticed in a hundred proclamations, and in one, of the year just elapsed, by the actual governor. You shall see, you shall see! Where can it be?” said he, plunging his hand amidst the chaos of papers; “it must surely be here, as it is a decree of great importance. Ah! here it is, here it is!” He unfolded it, looked at the date, and with a serious face exclaimed, “Fifteenth of October, 1627. Yes, yes, this is it; a new edict; these are those which cause terror—Do you know how to read, my son?”

“A little, Signor Doctor.”

“Well now, come behind me, and you will see for yourself.”

Holding the proclamation extended before him, he began to read, stammering rapidly over some passages, and pausing distinctly with great expression on others, according to the necessity of the case.

“Although by the proclamation published by order of the Signor Duke di Feria, on the 14th of December, 1620, and ratified by the most illustrious, and most excellent lord, Signor Gonsalez Fernandez de Cordova, &c. &c.—had by extraordinary and rigorous remedies provided against the oppressions, exactions, and other tyrannical acts committed against the devoted vassals of His Majesty; the frequency of the excesses, however, &c. &c., has arrived at such a point that His Excellency is under the necessity, &c. &c.—wherefore, with the concurrence of the Senate and Convention, &c. &c.—has resolved to publish the present decree.” “And from the tyrannical acts which the skill of many in the villages, as well as in the cities.”—“Do you hear”—umph—“exact and oppress the weak in various ways, making violent contracts of purchase, of rent, &c.”—“Where is it? Ah! here it is, listen, listen,”—“who, whether matrimony follow or not.”

“Ah! that's my case!” said Renzo.

“Listen, listen, here is more; now we will find the punishment.” Umph—“that they leave the place of their abode, &c. &c.—that if one pays a debt he must not be molested.” “All this has nothing to do with us. Ah! here it is!” “the priest refusing to do that to which he is obliged by his office,”—“Eh?”

“It appears the proclamation was made purposely for me.”

“Ah! is it not so? listen, listen.” “And other similar oppressions which flow from the vassals, nobility, middle and lower classes.” “None escape, they are all here—it is like the valley of Jehoshaphat. Hear now the penalty.” “For all these and other similar evil deeds, which having been prohibited, it is nevertheless necessary to exact with rigour, &c.—His Excellency, not annulling, orders and commands, that whoever the offenders be, they shall be subjected to pecuniary and corporal punishment—to banishment, the galleys, or to death,” “a mere trifle!” “at the will of His Excellency, or of the Senate. And from this there is no escape, &c. &c.” “And see here the signature,” “Gonsalez Fernandez de Cordova;” “and lower down,” “Platonas;” “and here again”—“Videt Ferrar,” “nothing is wanting.” Whilst the doctor was reading, Renzo had kept his eyes on the paper, seeking to ascertain for himself its real meaning. The doctor, perceiving his new client more attentive than dismayed, marvelled greatly. “He must be enrolled as one of the bravoes,” said he to himself; “Ah! ah!” exclaimed he, addressing Renzo, “you have shaved off the long lock! Well, well, it was prudent; but placing yourself in my hands, you need not have done so. The case is a serious one—you can have no idea how much resolution is required to conduct these matters wisely.”

To understand this mistake of the doctor's, it should be known, that the bravoes by profession used to wear a long lock of hair, which they pulled over the face as a mask in enterprises that required prudence as well as strength. The proclamation had not been silent with regard to this custom.

“His Excellency commands, that whosoever shall wear hair of such a length as to cover the forehead to the eyebrows, will incur the penalty of a fine of three hundred crowns; in case of incapability of payment, three years in the galleys for the first offence; and for the second, in addition to the aforesaid, greater punishments still, at the will of His Excellency.” The long lock had become a distinctive mark of the loose and disorderly.

“Indeed, indeed,” replied Renzo, “I have never worn a long lock in my life.”

“I can do nothing,” replied the doctor, shaking his head, with a knowing and rather impatient smile, “nothing, if you do not trust me. He who utters falsehoods to the doctor is a fool who will tell the truth to the judge. It is necessary to relate things plainly to the lawyer, but it rests with us to render them more intricate. If you wish me to help you, you must tell all from beginning to end, as to your confessor: you must name the person who commissioned you to do the deed; doubtless he is a person of consequence; and, considering this, I will go to his house to perform an act of duty. I will not betray you at all, be assured; I will tell him I come to implore his protection for a poor calumniated youth; and we will together use the necessary means to finish the affair in a satisfactory manner. You understand; in securing himself, he will likewise secure you. If, however, the business has been all your own, I will not withdraw my protection: I have extricated others from worse difficulties; provided you have not offended a person of consequence;—you understand—I engage to free you from all embarrassment, with a little expense—you understand. As to the curate, if he is a person of judgment, he will keep his own counsel; if he is a fool, we will take care of him. One may escape clear out of every trouble; but for this, a man, a man is necessary. Your case is a very, very serious one—the edict speaks plainly; and if the thing rested between you and the law, to be candid, it would go hard with you. If you wish to pass smoothly—money and obedience!”

Whilst the doctor poured forth this rhapsody, Renzo had been regarding him with mute astonishment, as the countryman watches the juggler, whom he sees cramming his mouth with handful after handful of tow; when, lo! he beholds immediately drawn forth from the same mouth a never-ending line of riband. When at last he perceived his meaning, he interrupted him with, “Oh! Signor Doctor, how you have misunderstood me! the matter is directly the reverse; I have threatened no one—not I—I never do such things; ask my companions, all of them, and they will tell you I never had any thing to do with the law. The injury is mine, and I have come to you to know how I can obtain justice, and am well satisfied to have seen this proclamation.”

“The devil!” exclaimed the doctor, opening wide his eyes; “what a cock and a bull story you have made! So it is; you are all alike: is it possible you can't tell a plain fact?”

“But, Signor Doctor, you must pardon me, you have not given me time; now I will tell you all. Know, then, that I was to have been married to-day”—and here his voice trembled—“was to have been married to-day to a young person to whom I have been some time betrothed; to-day was the day fixed upon by the Signor Curate, and every thing was in readiness. The Signor Curate began to make excuses—and—not to weary you—I compelled him to tell me the cause; and he confessed that he had been forbidden, on pain of death, to perform the ceremony. This powerful Don Roderick——”

“Eh!” hastily interrupted the doctor, contracting his brow and wrinkling his red nose, “away with you; what have I to do with these idle stories? Tell them to your companions, and not to one of my condition. Begone; do you think I have nothing to do but listen to tales of this sort——”

“I protest——”

“Begone, I say; what have I to do with your protestations? I wash my hands from them!” and pacing the room, he rubbed his hands together, as if really performing that act. “Hereafter learn when to speak; and do not take a gentleman by surprise.”

“But hear me, hear me,” vainly repeated Renzo.

The doctor, still growling, pushed him towards the door, set it wide open, called the maid, and said to her, “Return this man immediately what he brought, I will have nothing to do with it.” The woman had never before been required to execute a similar order, but she did not hesitate to obey; she took the fowls and gave them to Renzo with a compassionate look, as if she had said, “You certainly have made some very great blunder.” Renzo wished to make apologies; but the doctor was immovable. Confounded, therefore, and more enraged than ever, he took back the fowls and departed, to render an account of the ill success of his expedition.

At his departure, Agnes and Lucy had exchanged their nuptial robes for their humble daily habits, and then, sorrowful and dejected, occupied themselves in suggesting fresh projects. Agnes expected great results from Renzo's visit to the doctor; Lucy thought that it would be well to let Father Christopher know what had happened, as he was a man who would not only advise, but assist whenever he could serve the unfortunate; Agnes assented, but how was it to be accomplished? the convent was two miles distant, and at this time they certainly could neither of them hazard a walk thither. Whilst they were weighing the difficulties, some one knocked at the door, and they heard a low but distinct Deo Gracias. Lucy, imagining who it was, hastened to open it; and, bowing low, there entered a capuchin collector of contributions, with his wallet swung over his left shoulder. “Oh! brother Galdino!” said Agnes. “The Lord be with you,” said the brother; “I come for your contribution of nuts.”

“Go, get the nuts for the fathers,” said Agnes. Lucy obeyed; but before she quitted the room, she gave her mother a kind and impressive look, as much as to say, “Be secret.”

The capuchin, looking significantly at Agnes, said, “And the wedding? It was to have taken place to-day; what has happened?”

“The curate is sick, and we are obliged to defer it,” replied the dame, in haste; “but what success in the contributions?” continued she, anxious to change the subject, which she would willingly have prolonged, but for Lucy's earnest look.

“Very poor, good dame, very poor. This is all,” said he, swinging the wallet from his shoulder—“this is all; and for this I have been obliged to knock at ten doors.”

“But the year is a scarce one, brother Galdino, and when we have to struggle for bread, our alms are necessarily small.”

“If we wish abundance to return, my good dame, we must give alms. Do you not know the miracle of the nuts, which happened many years ago in our convent of Romagna?”

“No, in truth; tell me.”

“Well you must know, then, that in this convent there was one of our fathers who was a saint; he was called Father Macario. One winter's day, passing by a field of one of our patrons,—a worthy man he was,—he saw him standing near a large nut tree, and four peasants with their axes raised to level it to the ground. ‘What are you doing to the poor tree?’ demanded father Macario. ‘Why, father, it is unfruitful, and I am about to cut it down.’ ‘Do not do so, do not do so,’ said the father; ‘I tell you that next year it will bear more nuts than leaves.’ The master ordered the workmen to throw at once the earth on the roots which had been already bared; and, calling after the Father Macario, said, ‘Father Macario, the half of the crop shall be for the convent.’ The prediction was noised about, and every one went to look at the tree. In fact, when spring arrived, there were flowers in abundance, and afterwards nuts in abundance! But there was a greater miracle yet, as you shall hear. The owner, who, before the nut season, was called hence to enjoy the fruits of his charity, left a son of a very different character from himself. Now, at the time of harvest, the collector went to receive his appointed portion; but the son affected entire ignorance, and presumptuously replied, he never had understood that the capuchins knew how to make nuts. Now guess what happened then. One day he had invited to dinner some friends, and, making merry, he amused them with the story of the nuts; they desired to visit his granary, to behold his abundance; he led the way, advanced towards the corner where they had been placed, looked—and what do you think he saw?—a heap of dry nut leaves! Was not this a miracle? And the convent gained, instead of suffering loss; the profusion of nuts bestowed upon it in consequence was so great, that one of our patrons, compassionating the poor collector, gave him a mule to assist in carrying them home. And so much oil was made, that it was freely given to the poor; like the sea, which receives waters from every part, and distributes abundantly to the rivers.”

Lucy now reappeared with her apron so loaded with nuts, that she could with difficulty support the burthen. Whilst Friar Galdino untied his wallet to receive them, Agnes cast an astonished and displeased glance at her for her prodigality; she returned it with a look which seemed to say, “I will satisfy you.” The friar was liberal of thanks, and, replacing his wallet, was about to depart, when Lucy called him back. “I wish you to do me a service,” said she; “I wish you to say to Father Christopher that I have a great desire to speak with him, and request him to have the goodness to come hither immediately, as it is impossible for me to go to the convent.”

“Willingly; an hour shall not elapse before Father Christopher shall be informed of your wish.”

“I rely on you.”

“Trust me,” said he, “I will be faithful,” and moved off, bending under the increased weight of his wallet. We must not suppose, from the readiness with which Lucy sent this request to Father Christopher, and the equal readiness of Father Galdino to carry it, that the father was a person of no consequence; on the contrary, he was a man of much authority amongst his companions, and throughout all the neighbourhood. To serve the feeble, and to be served by the powerful; to enter the palace and the hut; to be at one time a subject of pastime, and at another regarded with profound respect; to seek alms, and to bestow them;—to all these vicissitudes a capuchin was well accustomed. The name of Friar, at this period, was uttered with the greatest respect, and with the most bitter contempt; of both of which sentiments, perhaps, the capuchins were, more than any other order, the objects. They possessed no property, wore a coarser habit than others, and made a more open profession of humility; they therefore exposed themselves, in a greater degree, to the veneration or the scorn which might result from the various characters among men.

The Friar Galdino being gone, “Such a quantity of nuts!” exclaimed Agnes, “and in a year of scarcity!”—“I beg pardon,” replied Lucy; “but if we had been as penurious as others in our charity, who can tell how long the friar would have been in reaching home, or, amongst all the gossipings, whether he would have remembered——”

“True, true, it was a good thought; and besides, charity always produces good fruit,” said Agnes, who, with all her defects, was a kind-hearted woman, and would have sacrificed every thing she had in the world for the sake of her child, in whom she had reposed all her happiness.

Renzo entered at this moment, with an angry and mortified countenance. “Pretty advice you gave me!” said he to Agnes. “You sent me to a fine man, indeed! to one truly who aids the distressed!” And he briefly related his interview with the doctor. The dame, astonished at the issue, endeavoured to prove that the advice was good, and that the failure must have been owing to Renzo himself. Lucy interrupted the debate, by informing him of her message to Father Christopher: he seized with avidity the new hopes inspired by the expectation of assistance from so holy a man. “But if the father,” said he, “should not extricate us from our difficulties, I will do it myself by some means or other.” Both mother and daughter implored him to be patient and prudent.

“To-morrow,” said Lucy, “Father Christopher will certainly be here, and he will no doubt suggest to us some plan of action which we ourselves would not have thought of in a year.”

“I hope so,” said Renzo; “but if not, I will obtain redress, or find another to do it for me; for surely there must be justice to be had in the world.”

Their mournful conversation might have continued much longer, but approaching night warned him to depart.

“Good night!” said Lucy mournfully, to Renzo, who could hardly resolve to go.

“Good night!” replied he, yet more sadly.

“Some saint will watch over us,” said she. “Be patient and prudent.” The mother added some advice of the like nature. But the disappointed bridegroom, with a tempest in his heart, left them, repeating the strange proposition—“Surely, there's justice in the world.” So true is it that, under the influence of great misfortune, men no longer know what they say.
CHAPTER IV.

The sun had not yet risen above the horizon, when Father Christopher left the convent of Pescarenico, to go to the cottage where he was so anxiously expected. Pescarenico is a small hamlet on the left bank of the Adda, or, rather, of the Lake, a few steps below the bridge; a group of houses, inhabited for the most part by fishermen, and adorned here and there with nets spread out to dry. The convent was situated (the building still subsists) at a short distance from them, half way between Lecco and Bergamo.

The sky was clear and serene. As the sun rose behind the mountain, its rays brightened the opposite summits, and thence rapidly spread themselves over the declivities and valleys; a light autumn breeze played through the leaves of the mulberry trees, and brought them to the ground. The vineyards were still brilliant with leaves of various hues; and the newly made nets appeared brown and distinct amid the fields of stubble, which were white and shining with the dew. The scene was beautiful; but the misery of the inhabitants formed a sad contrast to it. At every moment you met pale and ragged beggars, some grown old in the trade, others youthful, and induced to it from extreme necessity. They passed quietly by Father Christopher, and although they had nothing to hope from him, since a capuchin never touches money, they bowed low in thanks for the alms they had received, or might hereafter receive at the convent. The spectacle of the labourers scattered in the fields was still more mournful; some were sowing thinly and sparingly their seed, as if hazarding that which was too precious; others put the spade into the earth with difficulty, and wearily turned up the clods. The pale and sickly child was leading the meagre cattle to the pasture ground, and as he went along plucked carefully the herbs found in his path, as food for his family. This melancholy picture of human misery increased the sadness of Father Christopher, who, when he left the convent, had been filled with presentiments of evil.

But why did he feel so much for Lucy? And why, at the first notice, did he hasten to her with as much solicitude as if he had been sent for by the Father Provincial. And who was this Father Christopher? We must endeavour to satisfy all these enquiries.

Father Christopher, of ——, was a man nearer sixty than fifty years of age. His head was shaven, with the exception of the band of hair allowed to grow round it like a crown, as was the custom of the capuchins; the expression of his countenance was habitually that of deep humility, although occasionally there passed over it flashes of pride and inquietude, which were, however, succeeded by a deeper shade of self-reproach and lowliness. His long grey beard gave more character to the shape of the upper part of his head, on which habitual abstinence had stamped a strong expression of gravity. His sunken eyes were for the most part bent to the earth, but brightened at times with unexpected vivacity, which he ever appeared to endeavour to repress. His name, before entering the convent, had been Ludovico; he was the son of a merchant of ——, who, having accumulated great wealth, had renounced trade in the latter part of his life, and having resolved to live like a gentleman, he studied every means to cause his former mode of life to be forgotten by those around him. He could not, however, forget it himself; the shop, the goods, the day-book, the yard measure, rose to his memory, like the shade of Banquo to Macbeth, amidst the pomp of the table and the smiles of his parasites; whose continual effort it was to avoid any word which might appear to allude to the former condition of the host. Ludovico was his only child: he caused him to be nobly educated, as far as the laws and customs permitted him to do so; and died, bequeathing him a splendid fortune. Ludovico had contracted the habits and feelings of a gentleman, and the flatterers who had surrounded him from infancy had accustomed him to the greatest deference and respect. But he found the scene changed when he attempted to mingle with the nobility of the city; and that in order to live in their company he must school himself to patience and submission, and bear with contumely on every occasion. This agreed neither with his education nor his disposition. He retired from them in disgust, but unwillingly, feeling that such should naturally have been his companions; he then resolved to outdo them in pomp and magnificence, thereby increasing the enmity with which they had already regarded him. His open and violent nature soon engaged him in more serious contests: he sincerely abhorred the extortions and injuries committed by those to whom he had opposed himself; he therefore habitually took part with the weak against the powerful, so that by degrees he had constituted himself the defender of the oppressed, and the vindicator of their wrongs. The office was onerous; and fruitful in evil thoughts, quarrels, and enmities against himself. But, besides this external warfare, he perhaps suffered still more from inward conflicts; for often, in order to compass his objects, he was obliged to adopt measures of circumvention and violence, which his conscience disapproved. He was under the painful necessity of keeping in pay a band of ruffians for his own security, as well as to aid him in his enterprises; and for these purposes he was necessarily obliged to select the boldest, that is, the vilest, and to live with vagabonds from a love of justice; so that, disgusted with the world and its conflicts, he had many times seriously thought of entering some monastery, and retiring from it for ever. Such intentions were more strongly entertained on the failure of some of his enterprises, or the perception of his own danger, or the annoyance of his vicious associates, and would probably have still continued intentions, but for one of the most serious and terrible events of his hazardous mode of life.

He was walking one day through the streets of the city, accompanied by a former shopman, who had been transformed by his father into a steward, followed by two bravoes. The name of the shopman was Christopher; he was a man about fifty years of age, devoted to the master whom he had tended in infancy, and upon whose liberality he supported himself, his wife, and a large family of children. Ludovico saw a gentleman approaching at a distance, with whom he had never spoken in his life, but whom he hated for his arrogance and pride, which hatred the other cordially returned. He had in his train four bravoes; he advanced with a haughty step, and an expression of insolence and disdain on his countenance. It was Ludovico's right, being on the left side, to pass nearest the wall, according to the custom of the day, and every one was tenacious of this privilege. As they met they stopped face to face, like two figures on a bass relief, neither of them being disposed to yield to the other. The gentleman, eyeing Ludovico proudly and imperiously, said, with a corresponding tone of voice, “Pass on the outside.”

“Pass there yourself,” replied Ludovico, “the street is mine.”

“With persons of your condition the street is always mine.”

“Yes, if your arrogance were a law to others.”

The attendants of each stood still, with their hands on their daggers, prepared for battle. The passers-by retreated to a distance to watch the event.

“Pass on, vile mechanic, or I will teach you the civility due to a gentleman.”

“You lie; I am not vile.”

“Ha! Do you give me the lie? If you were a gentleman I would soon settle matters with my sword.”

“You are a coward also, or you would not hesitate to support by deeds the insolence of your words.”

“Throw this rascal in the dirt,” said the gentleman, turning to his followers.

“Let us see who will dare to do so,” said Ludovico, stepping back and laying his hand on his sword.

“Rash man,” cried the other, unsheathing his own, “I will break this in pieces when it shall have been stained with your base blood.”

They rushed violently on each other; the servants of both sprang to the defence of their masters. The combat was unequal in numbers, and also unequal from Ludovico's desire to defend himself rather than to wound his enemy; whilst the latter intended nothing less than murder. Ludovico was warding off the dagger of one of the bravoes, after having received a slight scratch on the cheek, when his enemy thrust at him from behind; Christopher, seeing his master's peril, went to his assistance; upon this the anger of the enraged cavalier was turned against the shopman, and he thrust him through the heart with his sword. Ludovico, as if beside himself at the sight, buried his weapon in the breast of the murderer, who fell almost at the same instant with the poor Christopher! The attendants of the gentleman, beholding him on the ground, took to flight; and Ludovico found himself alone, in the midst of a crowd, with two bodies lying at his feet.

“What has happened? One—two—he has been thrust through the body. Who is killed? A nobleman.—Holy Virgin! what destruction! who seeks, finds.—A moment pays all.—What a wound!—It must have been a serious affair!—And this unfortunate man!—Mercy! what a spectacle!—Save, save him.—It will go hard with him also.—See how he is wounded—he is covered with blood!—Escape, poor man, escape; do not let yourself be taken.” These words expressed the common suffrage, and with advice came also assistance; the affair had taken place near a church of the capuchins, an asylum impenetrable to the officers of justice. The murderer, bleeding and stupified, was carried thither by the crowd; the brotherhood received him from their hands with this recommendation, “He is an honest man who has made a proud rascal cold; but he did it in his own defence.”

Ludovico had never before shed blood, and although in these times murder was a thing so common that all ceased to wonder at it, yet the impression which he received from the recollection of the dying (dying through his instrumentality,) was new and indescribable; a revelation of feelings hitherto unknown. The fall of his enemy, the alteration of those features, passing in a moment from angry threatenings to the solemn stillness of death; this was a spectacle which wrought an instantaneous change in the soul of the murderer. Whilst they were carrying him to the convent he had been insensible to what was passing; returning to his senses, he found himself in a bed of the infirmary, in the hands of a friar who was dressing his wounds. Another, whose particular duty it was to administer comfort to the dying, had been called to the scene of combat. He returned in a short time, and approaching Ludovico's bed, said, “Console yourself; he has died in peace, has forgiven you, and hoped for your forgiveness.” At these words the soul of Ludovico was filled with remorse and sorrow. “And the other?” asked he anxiously.

“The other had expired before I arrived.”

In the mean time the avenues and environs of the convent swarmed with people; the officers of justice arrived, dispersed the crowd, and placed themselves in ambush at a short distance from the gates, so that no one could pass through them unobserved. A brother of the deceased and some of his family appeared in full armour with a large attendance of bravoes, and surrounded the place, watching with a threatening aspect the bystanders, who did not dare say, he is safe, but they had it written on their faces.

Scarcely had Ludovico recalled his scattered thoughts, when he asked for a father confessor, prayed him to seek out the widow of Christopher, to ask forgiveness in his name for having been (however involuntarily) the cause of her affliction, and to assure her that he would take the care of her family on himself. Reflecting further on his own situation, his determination was made to become a friar. It seemed as if God himself had willed it, by placing him in a convent at such a conjuncture. He immediately sent for the superior of the monastery, and expressed to him his intention. He replied to him, that he should be careful not to form a resolution precipitately, but that, if he persisted, he would be accepted. Ludovico then sent for a notary, and made a donation of all his estate to the widow and family of Christopher.

The resolution of Ludovico happened opportunely for his hosts, who felt themselves embarrassed concerning him. To send him from the monastery, and thus expose him to justice and the vengeance of his enemies, was not to be thought of a moment; it would be the same as a renunciation of their privileges, a discrediting of the convent amongst the people; and they would draw upon themselves the animadversion of all the capuchins of the universe for this relinquishment of the rights of the order, this defiance of the ecclesiastical authorities, who then considered themselves the guardians of these rights. On the other hand, the family of the deceased, rich, and powerful in adherents, were determined on vengeance, and disposed to consider as enemies whoever should place obstacles to its accomplishment. History declares, not that they grieved much for the dead, or that a single tear was shed for him amongst his whole race, but that they were urged on by scenting the blood of his opponent. But Ludovico, by assuming the habit of a capuchin, removed all difficulties: to a certain degree he made atonement; imposed on himself penitence; confessed his fault; withdrew from the contest; he was, in short, an enemy who laid down his arms. The relations of the deceased could, if they pleased, believe and boast that he had become a friar through despair and dread of their revenge. And at all events, to reduce a man to dispossess himself of his wealth, to shave his head, to walk bare-footed, to sleep on straw, and to live on alms, might appear a punishment competent to the offence.

The superior presented himself before the brother of the deceased with an air of humility; after a thousand protestations of respect for his illustrious house, and of desire to comply with its wishes as far as was practicable, he spoke of the repentance and resolution of Ludovico, politely hoping that the family would grant their accordance; and then insinuating, mildly and dexterously, that, agreeable or not agreeable, the thing would take place. After some little vapouring, he agreed to it on one condition; that the murderer of his brother should depart immediately from the city. To this the capuchin assented, as if in obedience to the wishes of the family, although it had been already so determined. The affair was thus concluded to the satisfaction of the illustrious house, of the capuchin brotherhood, of the popular feeling, and, above all, of our generous penitent himself. Thus, at thirty years of age, Ludovico bade farewell to the world; and having, according to custom, to change his name, he took one which would continually recall to him his crime,—thus he became Friar Christopher!

Hardly was the ceremony of assuming the habit completed, when the superior informed him he must depart on the morrow to perform his noviciate at ——, sixty miles' distance. The noviciate bowed submissively. “Permit me, father,” said he, “before I leave the scene of my crime, to do all that rests with me now to repair the evil; permit me to go to the house of the brother of him whom I have murdered, to acknowledge my fault, and ask forgiveness; perhaps God will take away his but too just resentment.”

It appeared to the superior that such an act, besides being praiseworthy in itself, would serve still more to reconcile the family to the monastery. He therefore bore the request himself to the brother of the murdered man; a proposal so unexpected was received with a mixture of scorn and complacency. “Let him come to-morrow,” said he, and appointed the hour. The superior returned to Father Christopher with the desired permission.

The gentleman reflected that the more solemn and public the apology was, the more it would enhance his credit with the family and the world; he made known in haste to the members of the family, that on the following day they should assemble at his house to receive a common satisfaction. At mid-day the palace swarmed with nobility of either sex; there was a blending of veils, feathers, and jewels; a heavy motion of starched and crisped bands; a confused entangling of embroidered trains. The antechambers, the courts, and the street, were crowded with servants, pages, and bravoes.

Father Christopher experienced a momentary agitation at beholding all this preparation, but recovering himself, said, “It is well; the deed was committed in public, the reparation should be public.” Then, with his eyes bent to the earth, and the father, his companion, at his elbow, he crossed the court, amidst a crowd who eyed him with unceremonious curiosity; he entered, ascended the stairs, and passing through another crowd of lords, who made way for him at his approach, he advanced towards the master of the mansion, who stood in the middle of the room waiting to receive him, with downcast looks, grasping with one hand the hilt of his sword, and with the other pressing the cape of his Spanish cloak on his breast. The countenance and deportment of Father Christopher made an immediate impression on the company; so that all were convinced that he had not submitted to this humiliation from fear of man. He threw himself on his knees before him whom he had most injured, crossed his hands on his breast, and bending his head, exclaimed, “I am the murderer of your brother! God knows, that to restore him to life I would sacrifice my own; but as this cannot be, I supplicate you to accept my useless and late apology, for the love of God!”

All eyes were fixed in breathless and mute attention on the novice, and on the person to whom he addressed himself; there was heard through the crowd a murmur of pity and respect; the angry scorn of the nobleman relaxed at this appeal, and bending towards the kneeling supplicant, “Rise,” said he, with a troubled voice. “The offence—the deed truly—but the habit you wear—not only this—but on your own account—rise, father!—my brother—I cannot deny it—was a cavalier—of a hasty temper. Do not speak of it again. But, father, you must not remain in this posture.” And he took him by the arm to raise him. Father Christopher, standing with his eyes still bent to the ground, continued, “I may, then, hope that you have granted me your pardon. And if I obtain it from you, from whom may I not expect it? Oh! if I could hear you utter the word!”

“Pardon!” said the nobleman; “I pardon you with all my heart, and all——” turning to the company——“All! all!” resounded at once through the room.

The countenance of the father expanded with joy, under which, however, was still visible an humble and profound compunction for the evil, which the remission of men could not repair. The nobleman, entirely vanquished, threw his arms around his neck, and the kiss of peace was given and received.

Loud exclamations of applause burst from the company; and all crowded eagerly around the father. In the meanwhile the servants entered, bearing refreshments; the master of the mansion, again addressing Father Christopher, said, “Father, afford me a proof of your friendship by accepting some of these trifles.”

“Such things are no longer for me,” replied the father; “but if you will allow me a loaf of bread, as a memorial of your charity and your forgiveness, I shall be thankful.” The bread was brought, and with an air of humble gratitude he put it in his basket. He then took leave of the company; disentangled himself with difficulty from the crowd in the antechambers, who would have kissed the hem of his garment, and pursued his way to the gate of the city, whence he commenced his pedestrian journey towards the place of his noviciate.

It is not our design to write the history of his cloistral life; we will only say, he executed faithfully the offices ordinarily assigned to him, of preaching, and of comforting the dying; but beyond these, “the oppressor's wrongs, the proud man's contumely,” aroused in him a spirit of resistance which humiliation and remorse had not been able entirely to extinguish. His countenance was habitually mild and humble, but occasionally there passed over it a shade of former impetuosity, which was with difficulty restrained by the high and holy motives which now predominated in his soul. His tone of voice was gentle as his countenance; but in the cause of justice and truth, his language assumed a character of solemnity and emphasis singularly impressive. One who knew him well, and admired his virtues, could often perceive, by the smothered utterance or the change of a single word, the inward conflict between the natural impetus and the resolved will, which latter never failed to gain the mastery.

If one unknown to him in the situation of Lucy had implored his assistance, he would have granted it immediately; with how much more solicitude, then, did he direct his steps to the cottage, knowing and admiring her innocence, trembling for her danger, and experiencing a lively indignation at the persecution of which she had become the object. Besides, he had advised her to remain quiet, and not make known the conduct of her persecutor, and he felt or feared that his advice might have been productive of bad consequences. His anxiety for her welfare, and his inadequate means to secure it, called up many painful feelings, which the good often experience.

But while we have been relating his history, he arrived at the dwelling; Agnes and her daughter advanced eagerly towards him, exclaiming in one breath, “Oh! Father Christopher, you are welcome.”
CHAPTER V.

Father Christopher perceived immediately, from the countenances of Lucy and her mother, that some evil had occurred. “Is all well with you?” said he. Lucy replied by a flood of tears. “Quiet yourself, poor child,” continued he; “and do you,” turning to Agnes, “tell me what is the matter.” Whilst the good dame proceeded with the melancholy relation, he experienced a variety of painful emotions. The story being done, he buried his face in his hands, and exclaimed, “Oh, blessed God! how long?”—He then turned to Lucy; “Poor child! God has, indeed, visited you,” said he.

“You will not abandon us, father?” said Lucy, sobbing.

“Abandon you!” replied he. “How should I dare ask the protection of Almighty God for myself, if I abandoned you! You, so defenceless!—you, whom he has confided to me! Take courage! He will assist you—His eye beholds you—He can even make use of a feeble instrument like myself to confound a ——. Let us think what can be done.”

Thus saying, he grasped his beard and chin with his hand, as if to concentrate more completely the powers of his mind. But the more clearly he perceived the pressing nature of the case, the more uncertain and dangerous appeared every mode of meeting it. To endeavour to make Don Abbondio sensible of a failure in duty? This appeared hopeless; fear was more powerful with him than either shame or duty. To inform the cardinal archbishop, and invoke his authority? That would require time; and, in the meanwhile, what was to be done? To resist Don Roderick? How? Impossible! The affair being one of a private nature, he would not be sustained by the brethren of his order: he would, perhaps, be raising a storm against himself; and, what was worse, by a useless attempt render the condition of Lucy more hopeless and deplorable. After many reflections he came to the conclusion to go to Don Roderick himself, and to endeavour by prayers and representations of the punishments of the wicked in another state, to win him from his infamous purpose. At least he might at the interview discover something of his intentions, and determine his measures accordingly. At this moment Renzo, who, as the reader will readily imagine, could not long be absent at so interesting a crisis, appeared at the door of the room; the father raised his head and bowed to him affectionately, and with a look of intense pity.

“Have they told you, father?” enquired he, with a troubled voice.

“Yes, my son; and on that account I am here.”

“What do you say of the villain?”

“What do I say of him? I say to you, dear Renzo, that you must confide in God, and He will not abandon you.”

“Blessed words!” exclaimed the youth: “you are not one of those who wrong the poor. But the curate and this doctor——”

“Do not torment yourself uselessly: I am but a poor friar; but I repeat to you that which I have already said to Lucy and her mother—poor as I am, I will never abandon you.”

“Oh! you are not like the friends of the world—rascals—when I was in prosperity, abundant in protestations; ready to shed their blood for me, to sustain me against the devil! Had I an enemy, they would soon put it out of his power to molest me! And now, to see them withdraw themselves!” He was interrupted in his vituperations by the dark shade which passed over the countenance of his auditor; he perceived the blunder he had made, and attempting to remedy it, became perplexed and confused. “I would say—I did not at all intend—that is, I meant to say——”

“What did you mean to say? You have already begun to mar my undertaking. It is well that thou art undeceived in time. What! thou didst seek friends! and what friends! they could not have aided thee, had they been willing. And thou didst not apply to the only friend who can and will protect thee;—dost thou not know that God is the friend of all who trust in Him? dost thou not know that to spread the talons does little good to the weak? and even if——” at these words he grasped forcibly Renzo's arm; his countenance, without losing his wonted authority, displayed an affecting remorse; his eyes were fixed on the ground; and his voice became slow and sepulchral: “and even if that little should be gained, how terribly awful! Renzo, will you confide in me?—that I should say in me! a worm of the dust! will you not confide in God?”

“Oh! yes!” replied Renzo; “He only is the Lord.”

“Promise me, then, that you will not meet or provoke any one; that you will suffer yourself to be guided by me.”

“I promise,” said Renzo.

Lucy drew a long breath, as if relieved from a weight, and Agnes was loud in applauses.

“Listen, my children,” resumed Father Christopher: “I will go myself to-day to speak to this man: if God touches his heart through my words, well; if not, He will provide some other remedy. In the mean time keep yourselves quiet and retired; this evening, or to-morrow at the latest, you shall see me again.” Having said this, he departed amidst thanks and blessings.

He arrived at the convent in time to perform his daily duty in the choir, dined, and then pursued his way towards the den of the wild beast he had undertaken to tame.

The palace of Don Roderick stood by itself, on the summit of one of the promontories that skirt the coast; it was three or four miles distant from the village; at the foot of the promontory nearest the lake, there was a cluster of decayed cottages inhabited by peasantry belonging to Don Roderick. This was the little capital of his little kingdom. As you cast a glance within their walls, you beheld suspended to them various kinds of arms, with spades, mattocks, and pouches of powder, blended promiscuously. The persons within appeared robust and strong, with a daring and insulting expression of countenance, and wearing a long lock of hair on the head, which was covered with net-work. The aged, that had lost their teeth, seemed ready to show their gums at the slightest call: masculine women, with sinewy arms, seemed disposed to use them with as much indifference as their tongues; the very children exhibited the same daring recklessness as the parent stock. Friar Christopher passed through the hamlet, ascending a winding path which conducted him to the little esplanade in the front of the castle. The door was shut, which was a sign that the chief was dining and did not wish to be disturbed. The few windows that looked on the road were small and decayed by time; they were, however, secured by large iron bars; and the lowest of them were more than ten feet from the ground. A profound silence reigned within, and a traveller might have believed the mansion deserted, but for the appearance of four animals, two alive and two dead, in front of the castle. Two large vultures, with their wings expanded, were nailed each at the posts of the gate; and two bravoes, extended at full length on the benches on either side, were keeping guard until their master should have finished his repast. The father stopped, as if willing also to wait. “Father, father, come on,” said one, “we do not make the capuchins wait here; we are the friends of the convent; I have been within its walls when the air on the outside of them was not very wholesome for me; it was well the fathers did not refuse me admittance.” So saying, he gave two strokes with the knocker: at the sound, the howls of mastiffs were heard from within; and in a few moments there appeared an aged domestic. On seeing the father, he bowed reverently, quieted the animals with his voice, introduced the guest into a narrow court, and closed the gate. Then escorting him into a saloon, and regarding him with an astonished and respectful look, said, “Is not this—the Father Christopher of Pescarenico?”

“The same.”

“And here!”

“As you see, good man.”

“It must be to do good,” continued he, murmuring between his teeth; “good can be done every where.” He then guided him through two or three dark halls, and led the way to the banqueting room: here was heard a confused noise of plates, and knives and forks, and discordant voices. Whilst Father Christopher was urging the domestic to suffer him to remain in some other apartment until the dinner should be finished, the door opened. A certain Count Attilio, a cousin of the noble host, (of whom we have already spoken, without giving his name,) was seated opposite: when he saw the bald head and habit of the father, and perceived his motion to withdraw, “Ho! father,” cried he, “you sha'n't escape us; reverend father, forward, forward!” Don Roderick seconded somewhat unwillingly this boisterous command, as he felt some presentiment of the object of his visit. “Come, father, come in,” said he. Seeing there was no retreating, Father Christopher advanced, saluting the nobleman and his guests.

An honest man is generally fearless and undaunted in presence of the wicked; nevertheless, the father, with the testimony of a good conscience and a firm conviction of the justice of his cause, with a mixture of horror and compassion for Don Roderick, felt a degree of embarrassment in approaching him. He was seated at table, surrounded by guests; on his right was Count Attilio, his colleague in libertinism, who had come from Milan to visit him. To the left was seated, with respectful submissiveness, tempered, however, with conscious security, the podestà of the place,—he whose duty it was, according to the proclamation, to cause justice to be done to Renzo Tramaglino, and to inflict the allotted penalty on Don Roderick. Nearly opposite to the podestà sat our learned Doctor Azzecca Garbugli, with his black cap and his red nose; and over against him two obscure guests, of whom our story says nothing beyond a general mention of their toad-eating qualities.

“Give a seat to the father,” said Don Roderick. A servant presented a chair, and the good father apologised for having come at so inopportune an hour. “I would speak with you alone on an affair of importance,” added he, in a low tone, to Don Roderick.

“Very well, father, it shall be so,” replied he; “but in the meanwhile bring the father something to drink.”

Father Christopher would have refused, but Don Roderick, raising his voice above the tumult of the table, cried, “No, by Bacchus, you shall not do me this wrong; a capuchin shall never leave this house without having tasted my wine, nor an insolent creditor without having tasted the wood of my forests.” These words produced a universal laugh, and interrupted for a moment the question which was hotly agitated between the guests. A servant brought the wine, of which Father Christopher partook, feeling the necessity of propitiating the host.

“The authority of Tasso is against you, respected Signor Podestà,” resumed aloud the Count Attilio: “this great man was well acquainted with the laws of knighthood, and he makes the messenger of Argantes, before carrying the defiance of the Christian knights, ask permission from the pious Bouillon.”

“But that,” replied vociferously the podestà, “that is poetical licence merely: an ambassador is in his nature inviolable, by the law of nations, jure gentium; and moreover, the ambassador, not having spoken in his own name, but merely presented the challenge in writing——”

“But when will you comprehend that this ambassador was a daring fool, who did not know the first——”

“With the good leave of our guests,” interrupted Don Roderick, who did not wish the argument to proceed farther, “we will refer it to the Father Christopher, and submit to his decision.”

“Agreed,” said Count Attilio, amused at submitting a question of knighthood to a capuchin; whilst the podestà muttered between his teeth, “Folly!”

“But, from what I have comprehended,” said the father, “it is a subject of which I have no knowledge.”

“As usual, modest excuses from the father,” said Don Roderick; “but we will not accept them. Come, come, we know well that you came not into the world with a cowl on your head; you know something of its ways. Well, how stands the argument?”

“The facts are these,” said the Count Attilio——

“Let me tell, who am neutral, cousin,” resumed Don Roderick. “This is the story: a Spanish knight sent a challenge to a Milanese knight; the bearer, not finding him at home, presented it to his brother, who, having read it, struck the bearer many blows. The question is——”

“It was well done; he was perfectly right,” cried Count Attilio.

“There was no right about it,” exclaimed the podestà. “To beat an ambassador—a man whose person is sacred! Father, do you think this was an action becoming a knight?”

“Yes, sir; of a knight,” cried the count, “I think I know what belongs to a knight. Oh! if it had been an affair of fists, that would have been quite another thing, but a cudgel soils no one's hands.”

“I am not speaking of this, Sir Count; I am speaking of the laws of knighthood. But tell me, I pray you, if the messengers that the ancient Romans sent to bear defiance to other nations, asked permission to deliver the message; find, if you can, a writer who relates that such messenger was ever cudgelled.”

“What have the ancient Romans to do with us? a people well enough in some things, but in others, far, far behind. But according to the laws of modern knighthood, I maintain that a messenger, who dared place in the hands of a knight a challenge without having previously asked permission, is a rash fool who deserves to be cudgelled.”

“But answer me this question——”

“No, no, no.”

“But hear me. To strike an unarmed person is an act of treachery. Atqui the messenger de quo was without arms. Ergo——”

“Gently, gently, Signor Podestà.”

“How? gently.”

“Gently, I tell you; I concede that under other circumstances this might have been called an act of treachery, but to strike a low fellow! It would have been a fine thing truly, to say to him, as you would to a gentleman, Be on your guard! And you, Sir Doctor, instead of sitting there grinning your approbation of my opinion, why do you not aid me to convince this gentleman?”

“I,” replied the doctor in confusion; “I enjoy this learned dispute, and am thankful for the opportunity of listening to a war of wit so agreeable. And moreover, I am not competent to give an opinion; his most illustrious lordship has appointed a judge—the father.”

“True,” said Don Roderick; “but how can the judge speak when the disputants will not keep silence?”

“I am dumb,” said the Count Attilio. The podestà made a sign that he would be quiet.

“Well! father! at last!” said Don Roderick, with comic gravity.

“I have already said, that I do not comprehend——”

“No excuses! we must have your opinion.”

“If it must be so,” replied the father, “I should humbly think there was no necessity for challenges, nor bearers, nor blows.”

The guests looked in wonder at each other.

“Oh! how ridiculous!” said the Count Attilio. “Pardon me, father; but this is exceedingly ridiculous. It is plain you know nothing of the world.”

“He?” said Don Roderick; “he knows as much of it as you do, cousin. Is it not so, father?”

Father Christopher made no reply; but to himself he said, “submit thyself to every insult for the sake of those for whom thou art here.”

“It may be so,” said the count; “but the father——how is the father called?”

“Father Christopher,” replied more than one.

“But, Father Christopher, your reverend worship, with your maxims you would turn the world upside down—without challenges! without blows! Farewell, the point of honour! Impunity to ruffians! Happily, the thing is impossible.”

“Stop, doctor,” cried Don Roderick, wishing to divert the dispute from the original antagonists. “You are a good man for an argument; what have you to say to the father?”

“Indeed,” replied the doctor, brandishing his fork in the air—“indeed I cannot understand how the Father Christopher should not remember that his judgment, though of just weight in the pulpit, is worth nothing—I speak with great submission—on a question of knighthood. But perhaps he has been merely jesting, to relieve himself from embarrassment.”

The father not replying to this, Don Roderick made an effort to change the subject.

“Apropos,” said he, “I understand there is a report at Milan of an accommodation.”

There was at this time a contest regarding the succession to the dukedom of Mantua, of which, at the death of Vincenzo Gonzaga, who died without male issue, the Duke de Nevers, his nearest relation, had obtained possession. Louis XIII., or rather the Cardinal de Richelieu, wished to sustain him there; Philip IV., or rather the Count d'Olivares, commonly called the Count Duke, opposed him. The dukedom was then a fief of the empire, and the two parties employed intrigue and importunity at the court of the Emperor Ferdinand II. The object of one was to obtain the investiture of the new duke; of the other, the denial of his claim, and also assistance to oblige him to relinquish it.

“I rather think,” said the Count Attilio, “that the thing will be arranged satisfactorily. I have reasons——”

“Do not believe it, count, do not believe it,” added the podestà; “I have an opportunity of knowing, because the Spanish keeper of the castle, who is my friend, and who is the son of a dependant of the Count Duke, is informed of every thing.”

“I tell you I have discoursed on the subject daily at Milan; and I know from good authority that the pope, exceedingly interested as he is for peace, has made propositions——”

“That may be, the thing is in order; his Holiness does his duty; a pope should always endeavour to make peace between Christian princes; but the Count Duke has his own policy, and——”

“And, and, and, do you know, Signor Podestà, how much thought the emperor now gives to it? Do you believe there is no place but Mantua in the world! There are many things to provide for, signor, mind. Do you know, for instance, how far the emperor can trust this Prince of Valdistano, or di Vallistai, as they call him; and if——”

“His name, in the German language,” interrupted the magistrate, “is Wallenstein, as I have heard it uttered many times by the Spanish keeper of the castle. But be of good courage——”

“Do you dare teach me,” replied the count. Here Don Roderick whispered to him to cease contradiction, as there would be no end to it. He obeyed; and the podestà, like a vessel unimpeded by shoals, continued with full sails the course of his eloquence. “Wallenstein gives me but little anxiety; because the Count Duke has his eye every where; and if Wallenstein carries matters with a high hand, he will soon set him right. He has his eye every where, I say, and unlimited power; and if it is his policy that the Signor Duke of Nevers should not take root in Mantua, he will never flourish there, be assured. It makes me laugh to see the Signor Cardinal de Richelieu contend with an Olivares. The Count Duke, gentlemen,” pursued he, with the wind still in his favour, and much wondering at not meeting with opposition, “the Count Duke is an old fox—speaking with due respect—who would make any one lose his track: when he appears to go to the right, it would be safest to follow him to the left: no one can boast of knowing his designs; they who are to execute them, they who write the despatches, know nothing of them. I speak from authority, for the keeper of the castle deigns to confide in me. The Count Duke knows well enough how the pot boils in all the courts in Europe; and these politicians have hardly laid a plan, but he begins to frustrate it. That poor man, the Cardinal Richelieu, attempts and dissembles, toils and strives; and what does it all produce? When he has dug the mine, he finds a countermine already prepared by the Count Duke——”

None can tell when the magistrate would have cast anchor, if Don Roderick had not interrupted him. “Signor Podestà,” said he, “and you, gentlemen, a bumper to the Count Duke, and you shall then judge if the wine is worthy of the personage.” The podestà bowed low in gratitude for an honour he considered as paid to himself in part for his eloquent harangue.

“May Don Gaspero Guzman, Count de Olivares, Duke of St. Lucar, live a thousand years!” said he, raising his glass.

“May he live a thousand years!” exclaimed all the company.

“Help the father,” said Don Roderick.

“Excuse me,” replied he, “I could not——”

“How!” said Don Roderick; “will you not drink to the Count Duke? Would you have us believe that you hold to the Navarre party?”

This was the contemptuous term applied to the French interest at the time of Henry IV.

There was no reply to be made to this, and the father was obliged to taste the wine. All the guests were loud in its praise, except the doctor, who had kept silence. “Eh! doctor,” asked Don Roderick, “what think you of it?”

“I think,” replied the doctor, withdrawing his ruddy and shining nose from the glass, “that this is the Olivares of wines: there is not a liquor resembling it in all the twenty-two kingdoms of the king our master, whom God protect! I maintain that the dinners of the most illustrious Signor Don Roderick exceed the suppers of Heliogabalus, and that scarcity is banished for ever from this palace, where reigns a perpetual and splendid abundance.”

“Well said! bravo! bravo!” exclaimed with one voice the guests; but the word scarcity, which the doctor had accidentally uttered, suggested a new and painful subject. All spoke at once:—“There is no famine,” said one, “it is the speculators who——”

“And the bakers, who conceal the grain. Hang them!”

“That is right; hang them, without mercy.”

“Upon fair trial,” cried the magistrate.

“What trial?” cried Attilio, more loudly; “summary justice, I say. Take a few of them who are known to be the richest and most avaricious, and hang them.”

“Yes, hang them! hang them! and there will be grain scattered in abundance.”

Thus the party continued absorbing the wine, whose praises, mixed with sentences of economical jurisprudence, formed the burthen of the conversation; so that the loudest and most frequent words were, Nectar, and hang 'em.

Don Roderick had, from time to time, during this confusion, looked at the father: perceiving him calmly, but firmly, awaiting his leisure for the interview which had been promised him, he relinquished the hope of wearying him by its postponement. To send away a capuchin, without giving him an audience, was not according to his policy; and since it could not be avoided, he resolved to meet it at once: he rose from the table, excused himself to his guests, and saying proudly, “At your service, father,” led the way to another room.
CHAPTER VI.

“In what can I serve you?” said Don Roderick, as soon as they entered into the room. Such were his words, but his manner said plainly, “Remember before whom thou standest, weigh well thy words, and be expeditious.”

There were no means more certain to impart courage to Father Christopher than arrogance or pride. He had stood for a moment in some embarrassment, passing through his fingers the beads of the rosary that hung suspended from his girdle; but he soon “resumed new courage, and revived,” at the haughty air of Don Roderick. He had, however, sufficient command over himself to reply with caution and humility. “I come to supplicate you to perform an act of justice: some wicked persons have, in the name of your lordship, frightened a poor curate, and have endeavoured to prevent his fulfilling his duty towards an innocent and unoffending couple. You can by a word confound their machinations, and impart consolation to the afflicted. You can—and having it in your power—conscience, honour——”

“Speak to me of conscience, when I ask your advice on the subject; and as to my honour, know that I only am the guardian of it, and that whoever dares to meddle with it is a rash man.”

Friar Christopher, warned by these words that the intention of Don Roderick was to turn the conversation into a dispute, so as to win him from his original purpose, determined to bear whatever insult might be offered him, and meekly replied, “It was certainly not my intention to say any thing to displease you: correct me, reprove me; but deign to listen to me. By the love of Heaven, by that God before whom we must all appear, I charge thee, do not obstinately refuse to do justice to the innocent and oppressed! Think that God watches over them, that their imprecations are heard above, and——”

“Stop,” interrupted Don Roderick, rudely. “The respect I bear to your habit is great; but if any thing could make me forget it, it would be to see it worn by one coming as a spy into my house.”

These words spread an indignant glow over the face of the father; but swallowing them as a bitter medicine, he resumed: “You do not believe that I am such; you feel in your heart that I am here on no vile or contemptible errand. Listen to me, Signor Don Roderick; and Heaven grant that the day may never arrive, when you shall repent of not having listened to me! Listen to me, and perform this deed of justice and benevolence. Men will esteem you! God will esteem you! you have much in your power, but——”

“Do you know,” again interrupted Don Roderick with warmth, but with something like remorse, “that when the whim takes me to hear a sermon, I can go to church? But, perhaps,” continued he, with a forced smile of mockery, “you are putting regal dignity on me, and giving me a preacher in my own palace.”

“And to God princes are responsible for the reception of his messages; to God you are responsible; he now sends into your palace a message by one of his ministers, the most unworthy——”

“In short, father,” said Don Roderick, preparing to go, “I do not comprehend you: I suppose you have some affair of your own on hand; make a confidant of whom you please; but use not the freedom of troubling a gentleman any farther.”

“Don Roderick, do not say No to me; do not keep in anguish the heart of an innocent child! a word from you would be sufficient.”

“Well,” said Don Roderick, “since you think I have so much in my power, and since you are so much interested——”

“Yes!” said Father Christopher, anxiously regarding him.

“Well, advise her to come, and place herself under my protection; she will want for nothing, and no one shall disturb her, as I am a gentleman.”

At such a proposal, the indignation of the friar, which had hitherto been restrained with difficulty, loudly burst forth. All his prudence and patience forsook him: “Your protection!” exclaimed he, stepping back, and stretching forth both his hands towards Don Roderick, while he sternly fixed his eyes upon him, “your protection! You have filled the measure of your guilt by this wicked proposal, and I fear you no longer.”

“Dare you speak thus to me?”

“I dare; I fear you no longer; God has abandoned you, and you are no longer an object of fear! Your protection! this innocent child is under the protection of God; you have, by your infamous offer, increased my assurance of her safety. Lucy, I say; see with what boldness I pronounce her name before you; Lucy——”

“How! in this house——”

“I compassionate this house; the wrath of God is upon it! You have acted in open defiance of the great God of heaven and earth; you have set at naught his counsel; you have oppressed the innocent; you have trampled on the rights of those whom you should have been the first to protect and defend. The wrath of God is upon you! A day will come!”

“Villain!” said Don Roderick, who at first was confounded between rage and astonishment; but when he heard the father thundering forth this prediction, a mysterious and unaccountable dread took possession of his soul. Hastily seizing his outstretched arm, and raising his voice in order to drown the maledictions of the monk, he cried aloud, “Depart from me, rash villain, cowled spy!”

These words instantly cooled the glowing enthusiasm of Father Christopher. The ideas of insult and injury in his mind had long been habitually associated with those of suffering and silence. His usual habits resumed their sway, and he became calm; he awaited what farther might be said, as, after the strength of the whirlwind has passed, an aged tree naturally recomposes its branches, and receives the hail as Heaven sends it.

“Villain! scoundrel! talk to your equals,” said Don Roderick; “but thank the habit you bear for saving you from the chastisement which is your due. Begone this instant, and with unscathed limbs, or we shall see.” So saying, he pointed imperiously to an opposite door. The friar bowed his head, and departed, leaving Don Roderick to measure with hasty and agitated steps the field of battle.

When he had closed the door behind him, the father perceived a man stealing softly away through another, and he recognised him as the aged domestic who had been his guide to the presence of Don Roderick. Before the birth of that nobleman, he had been in the service of his father, who was a man of a very different character. At his death, the new master expelled all the domestics, with the exception of this one, whom he retained on account of two valuable qualifications; a high conception of the dignity of the house, and a minute knowledge of the ceremonial required to support that dignity. The poor old man had never dared even to hint disapprobation of the daily proceedings at the castle before the signor, but he would sometimes venture to allow an exclamation of grief and disapproval to escape him before his fellow servants, who were infinitely diverted by his simple honesty, and his warm love of the good old times. His censures did not reach his master's ears unaccompanied by a relation of the raillery bestowed upon them, so that he became an object of general ridicule. On the days of formal entertainment, therefore, the old man was a person of great importance.

Father Christopher bowed to him as he passed by him, and pursued his way; but the old man approached him with a mysterious air, and made a sign that he should follow him into a dark passage, where, speaking in an under tone, he said, “Father! I have heard all, and I want to speak to you.”

“Speak at once, then, good man.”

“Here! oh no! Woe be to us if the master suspect it! But I shall be able to discover much, and I will endeavour to come to-morrow to the convent.”

“Is there any base plot?”

“There is something hatching, certainly; I have long suspected it; but now I shall be on the look out, and I will come at the truth. These are strange doings—I live in a house where——But I wish to save my soul.”

“God bless you!” said the friar, placing his hands on his head, as he bent reverently towards him; “God reward you! Do not forget then to come to-morrow.”

“I will not,” replied the domestic; “but go, now, for the love of Heaven, and do not betray me.”

So saying, he looked cautiously on all sides, and led the way through the passage into a large hall, which fronted the court-yard, and pointing to the door, silently bade him “Farewell.”

When once in the street, and freed from this den of depravity, the father breathed more freely; he hastened down the hill, pale in countenance, and agitated and distressed by the scene he had witnessed, and in which he had taken so leading a part. But the unlooked-for proffer of the servant came like a cordial. It seemed as if Heaven had sent a visible sign of its protection—a clue to guide him in his intricate undertaking—and in the very house where it was least likely to be found. Occupied with these thoughts, he raised his eyes towards the west, and beheld the sun declining behind the mountain, and felt that he had but a few minutes in which to reach the monastery, without violating the absolute law of the capuchins, that none of the brotherhood should remain beyond the walls after sunset.

Meanwhile, in the cottage of Lucy there had been plans agitated of which it is necessary to inform the reader. After the departure of the father, they had continued some time in silence; Lucy, with a heavy heart, prepared the dinner; Renzo, wavering and anxious, knew not how to depart; Agnes was apparently absorbed with her reel, but she was really maturing a thought, which she in a few moments thus declared:—

“Listen, my children. If you will have the necessary courage and dexterity; if you will confide in your mother; I pledge myself to free you from perplexity, sooner than Father Christopher could do, although he is the best man in the world.” Lucy looked at her mother with an expression of astonishment rather than confidence, in a promise so magnificent. “Courage! dexterity!” cried Renzo, “say, say, what can I do?”

“Is it not true,” said Agnes, “that if you were married, your chief difficulty would be removed, and that for the rest we would easily find a remedy!”

“Undoubtedly,” said Renzo, “if we were married—The world is before us; and at a short distance from this, in Bergamo, a silk weaver is received with open arms. You know how often my cousin Bartolo has solicited me to go there, and enter into business with him; how many times he has told me that I should make a fortune, as he has done; and if I never listened to his request, it was—because my heart was here. Once married, we would all go together, and live happily far from the clutches of this villain, far from the temptation to do a rash deed. Is it not so, Lucy?”

“Yes,” said Lucy, “but how——”

“As I said,” resumed Agnes, “courage and dexterity, and the thing is easy.”

“Easy!” exclaimed they, in wonder.

“Easy,” replied Agnes, “if you are prudent. Hear me patiently, and I will endeavour to make you comprehend my project. I have heard it said by persons who knew, and moreover I have seen one instance of it myself, that a curate's consent is not necessary to render a marriage ceremony lawful, provided you have his presence.”

“How so?” asked Renzo.

“You shall hear. There must be two witnesses, nimble and cunning. You go to the curate; the point is to catch him unexpectedly, that he may have no time to escape. You say, ‘Signor Curate, this is my wife;’ Lucy says, ‘Signor Curate, this is my husband;’ you must speak so distinctly that the curate and the witnesses hear you, and the marriage is as inviolable as if the pope himself had celebrated it. When the words are once uttered, the curate may fret, and fume, and scold; it will be of no use, you are man and wife.”

“Is it possible?” exclaimed Lucy.

“Do you think,” said Agnes, “that the thirty years I was in the world before you, I learned nothing? The thing is as I tell you.”

The fact was truly such as Agnes represented it; marriages contracted in this manner were at that time held valid. Such an expedient was, however, not recurred to, but in cases of great necessity, and the priests made use of every precaution to avoid this compulsive co-operation.

“If it be true, Lucy!” said Renzo, regarding her attentively, with a supplicating expression.

“If it be true!” exclaimed Agnes. “Do you think I would say that which is not true? Well, well, get out of the difficulty as you can, I wash my hands from it.”

“Ah, no! do not abandon us!” said Renzo; “I mean not to suggest a doubt of it. I place myself in your hands; I look to you as to a mother.”

The momentary anger of Agnes vanished.

“But why, mamma,” said Lucy, in her usual modest tone, “why did not Father Christopher think of this?”

“Think you that it did not come into his mind?” replied Agnes; “but he would not speak of it.”

“Why?” exclaimed they, both at once.

“Why?—because, if you must know it, the friars do not approve of it.”

“If it is not right,” said Lucy, “we must not do it.”

“What!” said Agnes, “do you think I would advise you to do that which is not right? If, against the advice of your parents, you were going to marry a rogue—but, on the contrary, I am rejoiced at your choice, and he who causes the disturbance is the only villain; and the curate——”

“It is as clear as the sun,” said Renzo.

“It is not necessary to speak of it to Father Christopher,” continued Agnes. “Once over, what do you think he will say to you? ‘Ah! daughter, it was a great error; but it is done.’ The friars must talk thus; but, believe me, in his heart he will be well content.”

Lucy made no reply to an argument which did not appear to her very powerful; but Renzo, quite encouraged, said, “If it be thus, the thing is done.”

“Softly,” said Agnes; “there is need of caution. We must procure the witnesses; and find means to present ourselves to the curate unexpectedly. He has been two days concealed in his house; we must make him remain there. If he suspects your intention, he will be as cunning as a cat, and flee as Satan from holy water.”

Lucy here gained courage to offer her doubts of the propriety of such a course. “Until now we have lived with candour and sincerity,” said she; “let us continue to do so; let us have faith in God, and God will aid us. Father Christopher said so: let us listen to his advice.”

“Be guided by those who know better than you do,” said Agnes gravely. “What need of advice? God tells us, ‘Help thyself, and I will help thee.’ We will tell the father all about it, when it is over.”

“Lucy,” said Renzo, “will you fail me now? Have we not done all that we could do, like good Christians? Had not the curate himself fixed the day and the hour? And whose is the blame if we are now obliged to use a little management? No, you will not fail me. I go at once to seek the witnesses, and will return to tell you my success.” So saying, he hastily departed.

Disappointment sharpens the wit; and Renzo, who, in the straightforward path he had hitherto travelled, had not been required to subtilise much, now conceived a plan which would have done honour to a lawyer. He went directly to the house of one Anthony, and found him in his kitchen, employed in stirring a polenta of wheat, which was on the fire, whilst his mother, brother, and his wife, with three or four small children, were seated at the table, eagerly intent on the earthen pan, and awaiting the moment when it should be ready for their attack. But, on this occasion, the pleasure was wanting which the sight of dinner usually produces in the aspect of the labourer who has earned it by his industry. The size of the polenta was proportioned to the scantiness of the times, and not to the number and appetite of the assailants: and in casting a dissatisfied look on the common meal, each seemed to be considering the extent of appetite likely to survive it. Whilst Renzo was exchanging salutations with the family, Tony poured out the pudding on the pewter trencher prepared for its reception, and it appeared like a little moon within a large circumference of vapour. Nevertheless, the wife of Tony said courteously to Renzo, “Will you be helped to something?” This was a compliment that the peasants of Lombardy, however poor, paid to those who were, from any accident, present at their meals.

“I thank you,” replied Renzo; “I only came to say a few words to Tony; and, Tony, not to disturb your family, we can go and dine at the inn, and we shall then have an opportunity to converse.” The proposal was as agreeable as it was unexpected. Tony readily assented to it, and departed with Renzo, leaving to his family his portion of the polenta. They arrived at the inn, seated themselves at their ease in a perfect solitude, since the penury of the times had driven away the daily frequenters of the place. After having eaten, and emptied a bottle of wine, Renzo, with an air of mystery, said to Tony, “If you will do me a small service, I will do you a great one.”

“Speak, speak, command me,” said Tony, filling his glass; “I will go through fire to serve you.”

“You are twenty-five livres in debt to the curate, for the rent of his field, that you worked last year.”

“Ah! Renzo, Renzo! why do you mention it to me now? You've spoiled your kindness, and put to flight my good wishes.”

“If I speak to you of your debt,” said Renzo, “it is because I intend to give you the means of paying it.”

“Do you really?”

“Really; would this content you?”

“Content me! that it would, indeed; if it were only to be freed from those infernal shakings of the head the curate makes me every time I meet him. And then always, ‘Tony, remember; Tony, when shall we see each other for this business?’ When he preaches, he fixes his eyes on me in such a manner, I am almost afraid he will speak to me from the pulpit. I have wished the twenty-five livres to the devil a thousand times: and I was obliged to pawn my wife's gold necklace, which might be turned into so much polenta. But——”

“But, if you will do me a small favour, the twenty-five livres are ready.”

“Agreed.”

“But,” said Renzo, “you must be silent and talk to no one about it.”

“Need you tell me that?” said Tony; “you know me.”

“The curate has some foolish reason for putting off my marriage, and I wish to hasten it. I am told that the parties going before him with two witnesses, and the one saying, This is my wife, and the other, This is my husband, that the marriage is lawful. Do you understand me?”

“You wish me to go as a witness?”

“Yes.”

“And you will pay the twenty-five livres?”

“Yes.”

“Done; I agree to it.”

“But we must find another witness.”

“I have found him already,” said Tony. “My simpleton of a brother, Jervase, will do whatever I tell him; but you will pay him with something to drink?”

“And to eat,” replied Renzo. “But will he be able?”

“I'll teach him; you know I was born with brains for both.”

“To-morrow.”

“Well.”

“Towards evening.”

“Very well.”

“But be silent,” said Renzo.

“Poh!” said Tony.

“But if thy wife should ask thee, as without doubt she will?”

“I am in debt to my wife for lies already; and for so much, that I don't know if we shall ever balance the account. I will tell her some idle story or other to set her heart at rest.” With this good resolution he departed, leaving Renzo to pursue his way back to the cottage. In the meanwhile Agnes had in vain solicited Lucy's consent to the measure; she could not resolve to act without the approbation of Father Christopher. Renzo arrived, and triumphantly related his success. Lucy shook her head, but the two enthusiasts minded her not. They were now determined to pursue their plan, and by authority and entreaties induce her finally to accede to it.

“It is well,” said Agnes, “it is well, but you have not thought of every thing.”

“What have I not thought of?” replied Renzo.

“Perpetua! You have not thought of Perpetua. Do you believe that she would suffer Tony and his brother to enter? How then is it probable she would admit you and Lucy?”

“What shall we do?” said Renzo, pausing.

“I will tell you. I will go with you; I have a secret to tell her, which will engage her so that she will not see you. I will take her aside, and will touch such a chord—you shall see.”

“Bless you!” exclaimed Renzo, “I have always said you were our best support.”

“But all this will do no good,” said Agnes, “if we cannot persuade Lucy, who obstinately persists that it is sinful.”

Renzo made use of all his eloquence, but Lucy was not to be moved. “I know not what to say to your arguments,” replied she. “I perceive that to do this, we shall degrade ourselves so far as to lie and deceive. Ah! Renzo, let us not so abase ourselves! I would be your wife” (and a blush diffused itself over her lovely countenance), “I would be your wife, but in the fear of God—at the altar. Let us trust in Him who is able to provide. Do you not think He will find a way to help us, far better than all this deception? And why make a mystery of it to Father Christopher?”

The contest still continued, when a trampling of sandals announced Father Christopher. Agnes had barely time to whisper in the ear of Lucy, “Be careful to tell him nothing,” when the friar entered.
CHAPTER VII.

“Peace be with you!” said the friar as he entered. “There is nothing more to hope from man: so much the greater must be our confidence in God; and I've already had a pledge of his protection.” None of the three entertained much hope from the visit of Father Christopher: for it would have been not only an unusual, but an absolutely unheard-of fact, for a nobleman to desist from his criminal designs at the mere prayer of his defenceless victim. Still, the sad certainty was a painful stroke.

The women bent down their heads; but in the mind of Renzo anger prevailed over disappointment. “I would know,” cried he, gnashing his teeth, and raising his voice as he had never done before in the presence of Father Christopher, “I would know what reasons this dog has given, that my wife should not be my wife?”

“Poor Renzo!” said the father, with an accent of pity, and with a look which greatly enforced moderation; “poor Renzo! if those who commit injustice were always obliged to give a reason for it, things would not be as they are!”

“He has said, then, the dog! that he will not, because he will not?”

“He has not even said so, poor Renzo! There would be something gained, if he would make an open confession of his iniquity.”

“But he has said something; what has this firebrand of hell said?”

“I could not repeat his words. He flew into a passion at me for my suspicions, and at the same time confirmed me in them: he insulted me, and then called himself offended; threatened, and complained. Ask no farther. He did not utter the name of Lucy, nor even pretend to know you: he affected to intend nothing. In short, I heard enough to feel that he is inexorable. But confidence in God! Poor children! be patient, be submissive! And thou, Renzo! believe that I sympathise with all that passes in thy heart.—But patience! It is a poor word, a bitter word to those who want faith; but, Renzo, will you not let God work? Will you not trust Him? Let Him work, Renzo; and, for your consolation, know that I hold in my hand a clue, by which I hope to extricate you from your distress. I cannot say more now. To-morrow I shall not be here; I shall be all day at the convent employed for you. Renzo, if thou canst, come there to me; but, if prevented by any accident, send some trusty messenger, by whom I can make known to you the success of my endeavours. Night approaches; I must return to the convent. Farewell! Faith and courage!” So saying, he departed, and hastened by the most abrupt but shortest road, to reach the convent in time, and escape the usual reprimand; or, what was worse, the imposition of some penance, which might disenable him, for the following day, from continuing his efforts in favour of his protégés.

“Did you hear him speak of a clue which he holds to aid us?” said Lucy; “it is best to trust in him; he is a man who does not make rash promises.”

“He ought to have spoken more clearly,” said Agnes; “or at least have taken me aside, and told me what it was.”

“I'll put an end to the business; I'll put an end to it,” said Renzo, pacing furiously up and down the room.

“Oh! Renzo!” exclaimed Lucy.

“What do you mean?” said Agnes.

“What do I mean? I mean to say that he may have a hundred thousand devils in his soul, but he is flesh and blood notwithstanding.”

“No, no, for the love of Heaven!” said Lucy, but tears choked her voice.

“It is not a theme for jesting,” said Agnes.

“For jesting?” cried Renzo, stopping before her, with his countenance inflamed by anger; “for jesting! you will see if I am in jest.”

“Oh! Renzo!” said Lucy, sobbing, “I have never seen you thus before!”

“Hush, hush!” said Agnes, “speak not in this manner. Do you not fear the law, which is always to be had against the poor? And, besides, how many arms would be raised at a word!”

“I fear nothing,” said Renzo; “the villain is well protected, dog that he is! but no matter. Patience and resolution! and the time will come. Yes! justice shall be done! I will free the country! People will bless me! Yes, yes.”

The horror which Lucy felt at this explicit declaration of his purpose inspired her with new resolution. With a tearful countenance, but determined voice, she said to Renzo, “It can no longer be of any consequence to you, that I should become yours; I promised myself to a youth who had the fear of God in his heart; but a man who had once——were you safe from the law, were you secure from vengeance, were you the son of a king——”

“Well!” cried Renzo, in a voice of uncontrollable passion, “well! I shall not have you, then; but neither shall he; of that you may——”

“For pity's sake, do not talk thus; do not talk so fiercely!” said Lucy imploringly.

“You to implore me!” said he, somewhat appeased. “You! who will do nothing for me! What proof do you give me of your affection? Have I not supplicated in vain? Have I been able to obtain——”

“Yes, yes,” replied Lucy, hastily, “I will go to the curate's to-morrow; now, if you wish it. Only be yourself again; I will go.”

“Do you promise me?” said Renzo, softening immediately.

“I promise.”

“Well, I am satisfied.”

“God be praised!” said Agnes, much relieved.

“I have promised you,” said Lucy, with an accent of timid reproach, “but you have also promised me to refer it to Father Christopher.”

“Ha! will you now draw back?” said Renzo.

“No, no,” said Lucy, again alarmed, “no, no, I have promised, and will perform. But you have compelled me to it by your own impetuosity. God forbid that——”

“Why will you prognosticate evil, Lucy? God knows we wrong no person.”

“Well, well,” said Lucy, “I will hope for the best.”

Renzo would have wished to prolong the conversation, in order to allot to each their several parts for the morrow, but the night drew on, and he reluctantly felt himself compelled to depart.

The night was passed, by all three, in that state of agitation and trouble which always precedes an important enterprise whose issue is uncertain. Renzo returned early in the morning, and Agnes and he busied themselves in concerting the operations of the evening. Lucy was a mere spectator; but although she disapproved these measures in her heart, she still promised to do the best she could.

“Will you go to the convent, to speak to Father Christopher, as he desired you last night?” said Agnes to Renzo.

“Oh! no,” replied he, “the father would soon read in my countenance that there was something on foot; and if he interrogated me, I should be obliged to tell him. You had better send some one.”

“I will send Menico.”

“Yes, that will do,” replied Renzo, as he hurried off to make farther arrangements.

Agnes went to a neighbouring house to obtain Menico, a smart lad of twelve years of age, who, by the way of cousins and sisters-in-law, was a sort of nephew to the dame. She asked and obtained permission of his parents to keep him all day “for a particular service.” She took him home, and after giving him breakfast, told him he must go to Pescarenico, and show himself to Father Christopher, who would send him back with a message.

“Father Christopher, you understand; that nice old man, with a white beard; him they call the Saint.”

“I know him, I know him!” said Menico: “he speaks so kindly to the children, and often gives them pictures.”

“Yes! that is he; and if, Menico, if he tells you to wait near the convent until he has an answer ready, don't stray away; don't go to the lake to throw stones in the water with the boys; nor to see them fish, nor——”

“Poh! aunt, I am no longer a baby.”

“Well, behave well, and when you return with the answer, I will give you these new parpagliole.”[3]

During the remainder of this long morning, several strange things occurred, calculated to infuse suspicion into the already troubled minds of Lucy and her mother. A mendicant, but not in rags like others of his kind, and with a dark and sinister countenance, narrowly observing every object around him, entered to ask alms. A piece of bread was presented to him, which he received with ill-dissembled indifference. Then, with a mixture of impudence and hesitation, he made many enquiries, to which Agnes endeavoured to return evasive replies. When about to depart, he pretended to mistake the door, and went through the one that led to the stairs. They called to him, “Stay, stay! where are you going, good man? this way.” He returned, excusing himself with an affectation of humility, to which he felt it difficult to compose his hard and stern features. After him, they saw pass, from time to time, other strange people. One entered the house, under pretence of asking the road; another stopped before the gate, and glanced furtively into the room, as if to avoid suspicion. Agnes went often to the door of the house during the remainder of the day, with an undefined dread of seeing some one approach who might cause them alarm. These mysterious visitations, however, ceased towards noon, but they had left an impression of impending evil on their minds, which they felt it impossible altogether to suppress.

To explain to the reader the true character of these suspicious wanderers, we must recur to Don Roderick, whom we left alone, in the hall of his palace, at the departure of Father Christopher. The more he reflected on his interview with the friar, the more was he enraged and ashamed, that he should have dared to come to him with the rebuke of Nathan to David on his lips. He paced with hurried steps through the apartment, and as he gazed at the portraits of his ancestors, warriors, senators, and abbots, which hung against its walls, he felt his indignation at the insult which had been offered him increase. A base-born friar to speak thus to one of noble birth! He formed plans of vengeance, and discarded them, without his being willing to acknowledge it to himself. The prediction of the father again sounded in his ears, and caused an unaccustomed perplexity. Restless and undetermined, he rang the bell, and ordered a servant to excuse him to the company, and to say to them, that urgent business prevented his seeing them again. The servant returned with the intelligence that the guests had departed. “And the Count Attilio?” asked Don Roderick.

“He has gone with the gentlemen, my lord.”

“Well; six followers to accompany me; quickly. My sword, cloak, and hat. Be quick.”

The servant left the room, and returned in a few moments with a rich sword, which his master girded on; he then threw the cloak around his shoulders, and donned his hat with its waving plumes with an air of proud defiance. He then passed into the street, followed by six armed ruffians, taking the road to Lecco. The peasantry and tradesmen shrunk from his approach; their profound and timid salutations received no notice from him; indeed, he acknowledged but by a slight inclination of the head those of the neighbouring gentry, whose rank, however, was incontestably inferior to his own. Indeed, the only man whose salutations he condescended to return upon an equal footing was the Spanish governor. In order to get rid of his ennui, and banish the idea of the monk and his imprecations, he entered the house of a gentleman, where a party was met together, and was received with that apparent cordiality which it is a necessary policy to manifest towards the powerful who are held in fear. On his return at night to his palace, he found Count Attilio seated at supper. Don Roderick, full of thought, took a chair, but said little.

Scarcely was the table cleared, and the servants departed, when the count, beginning to rally his dull companion, said, “Cousin, when will you pay me my wager?”

“San Martin's day has not yet passed.”

“Well, you will have to pay it; for all the saints in the calendar may pass, before you——”

“We will see about that!” said Don Roderick.

“Cousin, you would play the politician, but you cannot deceive me; I am so certain that I have won the wager, that I stand ready for another.”

“Why!”

“Why? because the father—the father—in short, this friar has converted you.”

“One of your fine imaginations, truly!”

“Converted, cousin, converted, I tell you; I rejoice at it; it will be a fine spectacle to see you penitent, with your eyes cast down! And how flattering to the father! he don't catch such fish every day. Be assured, he will bring you forward as an example to others; your actions will be trumpeted from the pulpit!”

“Enough, enough!” interrupted Don Roderick, half annoyed, and half disposed to laugh. “I will double the wager with you, if you please.”

“The devil! perhaps you have converted the father!”

“Do not speak of him; but as to the wager, San Martin will decide.” The curiosity of the count was aroused; he made many enquiries, which Don Roderick evaded, referring him to the day of decision.

The following morning, when he awoke, Don Roderick was “himself again.” The various emotions that had agitated him after his interview with the father, had now resolved themselves into the simple desire of revenge. Hardly risen, he sent for Griso.—“Something serious,” muttered the servant to whom the order was given; as this Griso was nothing less than the leader of the bravoes to whom was intrusted the most dangerous and daring enterprises, who was the most trusted by the master, and the most devoted to him, from gratitude and interest. This man had been guilty of murder; he had fled from the pursuit of justice to the palace of Don Roderick, who took him under his protection, and thus sheltered him from the pursuit of the law. He, therefore, stood pledged to the performance of any deed of villany that should be imposed on him.

“Griso,” said Don Roderick, “you must show your skill in this emergency. Before to-morrow, this Lucy must be in this palace.”

“It shall never be said that Griso failed to execute a command from his illustrious protector.”

“Take as many men as are necessary, and dispose of them as appears to you best; only let the thing succeed. But be careful that no harm be done to her.”

“Signor, a little fright—we cannot do less.”

“Fright—may be unavoidable. But touch not a hair of her head; and, above all, treat her with the greatest respect. Do you hear?”

“Signor, I could not take a flower from the bush, and carry it to your Highness, without touching it; but I will do only what is absolutely necessary.”

“Well; I trust thee. And—how wilt thou do it?”

“I was thinking, signor. It is fortunate that her cottage is at the extremity of the village; we have need of some place of concealment; and not far from her house there is that old uninhabited building in the middle of the fields, that one—but, your Highness knows nothing of these matters—which was burnt a few years ago, and, not having been repaired, is now deserted, except by the witches, who keep all cowardly rascals away from it; so that we may take safe possession.”

“Well; what then?”

Here Griso went on to propose, and Don Roderick to approve, until they had agreed upon the manner of conducting the enterprise to the desired conclusion, without leaving a trace of the authors of it: and also upon the manner of imposing silence, not only upon poor Agnes, but also upon the more impatient and fiery Renzo.

“If this rash fellow fall in your way by chance,” added Don Roderick, “you had best give him, on his shoulders, something he will remember; so that he will be more likely to obey the order to remain quiet, which he will receive to-morrow. Do you hear?”

“Yes, yes, leave it to me,” said Griso, as, with an air of importance, he took his leave.

The morning was spent in reconnoitring,—the mendicant of whom we have spoken was Griso; the others were the villains whom he employed, to gain a more perfect knowledge of the scene of action. They returned to the palace to arrange and mature the enterprise;—all these mysterious movements were not effected without rousing the suspicions of the old domestic, who, partly by listening, and partly by conjecture, came to the knowledge of the concerted attempt of the evening. This knowledge came a little too late, for already a body of ruffians were laying in wait in the old house. However, the poor old man, although well aware of the dangerous game he played, did not fail to perform his promise; he left the palace on some slight pretence, and hurried to the convent. Griso and his band left shortly after, and met at the old building,—the former had previously left orders at the palace, that, at the approach of night, there should be a litter brought thither,—he then despatched three of the bravoes to the village inn; one to remain at its entrance to observe the movements on the road, and to give notice when the inhabitants should have retired to rest; the other two to occupy themselves within as idlers, gaming and drinking. Griso, with the rest of the troop, continued in ambush, on the watch.

All this was going forward, and the sun was about to set, when Renzo entered the cottage, and said to Lucy and her mother, “Tony and Jervase are ready; I am going with them to sup at the inn; at the sound of the ‘Ave Maria,’ we will come for you; take courage, Lucy, all depends on a moment.”

“Oh, yes,” said Lucy, “courage;” with a voice that contradicted her words.

When Renzo and his companions arrived at the inn, they found the door blockaded by a sentinel, who, leaning on one side of it, with his arms folded on his breast, occupied half its width; at the same time rolling his eagle eyes first to the right and then to the left, displaying alternately their blacks and their whites. A flat cap of crimson velvet, placed sideways, covered the half of the long lock, which, parted on a dark forehead, was fastened behind with a comb. He held in his hand a club; his arms, properly speaking, were concealed beneath his garments. When Renzo evinced a desire to enter, he looked at him fixedly without moving; of this, the young man, wishing to decline all conversation, took no notice, but, beckoning to his companions to follow his example, slid between the figure and the door-post. Having gained an entrance, he beheld the other two bravoes with a large mug between them, seated at play; they stared at him with a look of enquiry, making signs to each other, and then to their comrade at the door. This was not unobserved by Renzo, and his mind was filled with a vague sentiment of suspicion and alarm. The innkeeper came for his orders; which were, “a private room, and supper for three.”

“Who are those strangers?” asked he of the landlord, when he came in to set the table.

“I do not know them,” replied he.

“How! neither of them?”

“The first rule of our trade,” said he, spreading the cloth, “is, not to meddle with the affairs of others; and, what is wonderful, even our women are not curious. It is enough for us that customers pay well; who they are, or who they are not, matters nothing. And now, I will bring you a dish of polpette, the like of which you have never eaten.”

When he returned to the kitchen, and was employed in taking the polpette from the fire, one of the bravoes approached, and said, in an under tone, “Who are those men?”

“Good people of this village,” replied the host, pouring the mince-meat into a dish.

“Well; but what are their names? Who are they?” insisted he, in a rough voice.

“One is called Renzo,” replied the host; “esteemed a good youth, and an excellent weaver of silk. The other is a peasant, whose name is Tony; a jovial fellow,—it is a pity he has no more money, for he would spend it all here. The other is a simpleton, who eats when they feed him. By your leave——” So saying, he slipped past him, with the dish in his hand, and carried it to the place of its destination.

“How do you know?” said Renzo, continuing the conversation from the point at which it had been dropped, “how do you know that they are honest men, when you are not acquainted with them?”

“From their actions, my good fellow; men are known by their actions. He who drinks wine without criticising it; he who shows the face of the king on the counter without prattling; he who does not quarrel with other customers, and, if he has a blow or two to give, goes away from the inn, so that the poor host need not suffer from it; he is an honest man. But what the devil makes you so inquisitive, when you are engaged to be married, and should have other things in your head? And with this mince-meat before you, which would make the dead revive?” So saying, he returned to the kitchen.

The supper was not very agreeable; the two guests would have lingered over the unusual luxury; but Renzo, preoccupied, and troubled and uneasy at the singular appearance of the strangers, longed for the hour of departure. He conversed in brief sentences, and in an under tone, so that he might not be overheard by them.

“What an odd thing it is,” blundered Jervase, “that Renzo wishes to be married, and has needed——” Renzo looked sternly at him. “Keep silence, you beast!” said Tony to him, accompanying the epithet with a cuff. Jervase obeyed, and the remainder of the repast was consumed in silence. Renzo observed a strict sobriety, in order to keep his companions under some restraint. Supper being over, he paid the reckoning, and prepared to depart: they were obliged to pass the three men again, and encounter a repetition of their eager gaze. When a few steps distant from the inn, Renzo, looking back, perceived that he was followed by the two whom he had left seated in the kitchen. He stopped; observing this, they stopped also, and retraced their steps.

If he had been near enough, he would have heard a few words of strange import; “It would be a glorious thing,” said one of the scoundrels, “without reckoning the cash, if we could tell at the palace how we had flattened their ribs,—without the direction, too, of Signor Griso.”

“And spoil the whole work,” added the other; “but see! he stops to look at us! Oh! if it were only later! But let us turn back, not to create suspicion. People are coming on all sides; let us wait till they go to their rests.”

Then was heard in the village the busy hum of the evening, which precedes the solemn stillness of the night; then were seen women returning from their daily labour, with their infants on their backs, and leading by the hand the older children, to whom they were repeating the evening prayers; men with their spades, and other instruments of culture, thrown over their shoulders. At the opening of the cottage doors, was discerned the bright light of the fires, kindled in order to prepare their meagre suppers; in the street there were salutations given and returned, brief and mournful observations on the poverty of the harvest, and the scarcity of the year; and at intervals was heard the measured strokes of the bell which announced the departure of the day.

When Renzo saw that the two men no longer followed him, he continued his way, giving instructions, in a low voice, from time to time, to his two companions. It was dark night when they arrived at the cottage of Lucy.

“Between the acting of a dreadful thing

And the first motion, all the interim is

Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream.”

Lucy endured many hours the anguish of such a dream; and Agnes, even Agnes, the author of the plot, was thoughtful and silent. But, in the moment of action, new and various emotions pass swiftly through the mind: at one instant, that which had appeared difficult becomes perfectly easy; at another, obstacles present themselves which were never before thought of, the imagination is filled with alarm, the limbs refuse their office, and the heart fails at the promise it had given with such security. At the gentle knock of Renzo, Lucy was seized with such terror, that, at the moment, she resolved to suffer any thing, to endure a separation from him for ever, rather than execute her resolution; but when, with an assured and encouraging air, he said, “All is ready; let us begone,” she had neither heart nor time to suggest difficulties. Agnes and Renzo placed her between them, and the adventurous company set forward. Slowly and quietly they took the path that led around the village,—it would have been nearer to pass directly through it, to Don Abbondio's house, but their object was to avoid observation. Upon reaching the house, the lovers remained concealed on one side of it, Agnes a little in advance, so as to be prepared to speak to Perpetua as soon as she should make her appearance. Tony, with Jervase, who did nothing, but without whom nothing could be done, courageously knocked at the door.

“Who is there, at this hour?” cried a voice from the window, which they recognised to be that of Perpetua. “No one is sick, that I know of. What is the matter?”

“It is I,” replied Tony, “with my brother; we want to speak with the curate.”

“Is this an hour for Christians?” replied Perpetua, briskly. “Come to-morrow.”

“Hear me; I will come, or not, as I choose; I have received I can't tell how much money, and I have come to balance the small account that you know of. I have here twenty-five fine new pieces; but if he cannot see me,—well—I know how and where to spend them.”

“Wait, wait. I will speak to you in a moment. But why come at this hour?”

“If you can change the hour, I am willing; as for me, I am here, and, if you don't want me to stay, I'll go away.”

“No, no, wait a moment; I will give you an answer.” So saying, she closed the window. As soon as she disappeared, Agnes separated herself from the lovers, saying to Lucy, in a low voice, “Courage, it is but a moment.” She then entered into conversation with Tony at the door, that Perpetua, on opening it, might suppose she had been accidentally passing by, and that Tony had detained her.
CHAPTER VIII.

“Carneades! who was he?” said Don Abbondio to himself, seated in his large chair, with a book open before him. “Carneades! this name I have either heard or read of; he must have been a man of study, a scholar of antiquity; but who the devil was he?” Now, it should be known, that it was Don Abbondio's custom to read a little every day, and that a curate, his neighbour, who had a small library, furnished him with books, one after the other, as they came to hand. That with which he was at this moment engaged, was a panegyric on St. Carlos, delivered many years before in the cathedral of Milan. The saint was there compared for his love of study to Archimedes; which comparison the poor curate well understood, inasmuch as this did not require, from the various anecdotes related of him, an erudition very extensive. But the author went on to liken him also to Carneades, and here the poor reader was at fault. At this moment, Perpetua announced the visit of Tony.

“At such an hour?” said Don Abbondio.

“What do you expect? They have no discretion. But if you do not shoot the bird flying——”

“Who knows if I shall ever be able to do it?” continued he. “Let him come in. But are you very sure that it is Tony?”

“The devil!” said Perpetua, as she descended, and, opening the door, demanded, “Where are you?”

Tony appeared, in company with Agnes, who accosted Perpetua by name.

“Good evening, Agnes,” said she; “whence come you at this hour?”

“I come from——,” naming a neighbouring village. “And do you know,” she continued, “that I have been delayed on your account?”

“On my account!” exclaimed she; and turning to the two brothers, said, “Go in, and I will follow you.”

“Because,” resumed Agnes, “a gossiping woman of the company said—would you believe it?—obstinately persisted in saying, that you were never engaged to Beppo Suolavecchia, nor to Anselmo Lunghigna, because they would not have you. I maintained that you had refused them both——”

“Certainly I did. Oh! what a liar! oh! what a great liar! Who was it?”

“Don't ask me; I don't wish to make mischief.”

“You must tell me; you must tell me. Oh! what a lie!”

“So it was; but you can't believe how sorry I felt not to know all the story, that I might have confuted her.”

“It is an infamous lie,” said Perpetua. “As to Beppo, every one knows——”

In front of Don Abbondio's house, there was a short and narrow lane, between two old cottages, which opened at the farther end into the fields. Agnes drew Perpetua thither, as if for the purpose of talking with her more freely. When they were at a spot, from which they could not see what passed before the curate's house, Agnes coughed loudly.

This was the concerted signal, which, being heard by Renzo, he, with Lucy on his arm, crept quietly along the wall, approached the door, opened it softly, and entered the passage, where the two brothers were waiting their approach. They all ascended the stairs on tiptoe; the brothers advanced towards the door of the chamber; the lovers remained concealed on the landing.

“Deo gratias,” said Tony, in a clear voice.

“Tony, eh? come in,” replied the voice from within. Tony obeyed, opening the door just enough to admit himself and brother, one at a time. The rays of light, which shone unexpectedly through this opening on the darkness by which Renzo and Lucy were protected, made the latter tremble as if already discovered. The brothers entered, and Tony closed the door; the lovers remained motionless without; the beating of poor Lucy's heart might be heard in the stillness.

Don Abbondio was, as we have said, seated in his arm chair, wrapped in a morning-gown, with an old cap on his head, in the fashion of a tiara, which formed a sort of cornice around his face, and shaded it from the dim light of a little lamp. Two thick curls which escaped from beneath the cap, two thick eyebrows, two thick mustachios, a dense tuft along his chin, all quite grey, and studding his sun-burnt and wrinkled visage, might be compared to snowy bushes projecting from a rock by moonlight.

“Ah! ah!” was his salutation, as he took off his spectacles and placed them on his book.

“Does the curate think I have come at too late an hour?” said Tony, bowing: Jervase awkwardly followed his example.

“Certainly, it is late; late on all accounts. Do you know that I am ill?”

“Oh! I am sorry.”

“Did you not hear that I was sick, and could not be seen? But why is this boy with you?”

“For company, Signor Curate.”

“Well; let us see.”

“Here are twenty-five new pieces, with the image of St. Ambrose on horseback,” said Tony, drawing forth a little bundle from his pocket.

“Give here,” said Don Abbondio; and taking the bundle, he opened it, counted the money, and found it correct.

“Now, sir, you will give me the necklace of my Teela.”

“Certainly,” replied Don Abbondio; and going to an old press, he drew forth the pledge, and carefully returned it.

“Now,” said Tony, “you will please to put it in black and white?”

“Eh!” said Don Abbondio, “how suspicious the world has become! Do you not trust me?”

“How! Sir. If I trust you! you do me wrong. But since my name is on your book on the side of debtor——”

“Well, well,” interrupted Don Abbondio; and seating himself at the table, he began to write, repeating, with a loud voice, the words as they came from his pen. In the meanwhile, Tony, and, at a sign from him, Jervase, placed themselves before the table, in such a manner as to deprive the writer of a view of the door; and, as if from heedlessness, moved their feet about on the floor, as a signal to those without, and also for the purpose of drowning the noise of their footsteps; of this Don Abbondio, occupied in writing, took no notice. At the grating sounds of the feet Renzo drew Lucy trembling into the room, and stood with her behind the brothers. Don Abbondio, having finished writing, read it over attentively, folded the paper, and reaching it to Tony, said, “Will you be satisfied now?” Tony, on receiving it, retired on one side, Jervase on the other, and, behold, in the midst, Renzo and Lucy! Don Abbondio, affrighted, astonished, and enraged, took an immediate resolution; and while Renzo was uttering the words, “Sir Curate, in the presence of these witnesses, this is my wife,” and the poor Lucy had begun, “And this is——” he had snatched from the table the cloth which covered it, throwing on the ground books, pen, ink, and paper, and in haste letting fall the light, he threw it over and held it wrapped around the face of Lucy, at the same time roaring out, “Perpetua! Perpetua! treachery! help!” The wick, dying in the socket, sent a feeble and flickering light over the figure of Lucy, who, entirely overcome, stood like a statue, making no effort to free herself. The light died away, and left them in darkness; Don Abbondio quitted the poor girl, and felt cautiously along the wall for a door that led to an inner chamber; having found it, he entered, and locked himself in, crying out, “Perpetua! treachery! help! out of the house! out of the house!” All was confusion in the apartment he had quitted; Renzo, groping in the dark to find the curate, had followed the sound of his voice, and was knocking at the door of the room, crying, “Open, open; don't make such an outcry;” Lucy calling to Renzo, in a supplicating voice, “Let us go, let us go, for the love of God!” Tony, creeping on all fours, and feeling along the floor for his receipt, which had been dropped in the tumult; the poor Jervase, crying and jumping, and endeavouring to find the door on the stairs, so as to escape with whole bones.

In the midst of this turmoil, we cannot stop to make reflections; but Renzo, causing disturbance at night in another person's house, and holding the master of it besieged in an inner room, has all the appearance of an oppressor; when in fact he was the oppressed. Don Abbondio, assaulted in his own house, while he was tranquilly attending to his affairs, appeared the victim; when, in fact, it was he who had inflicted the injury. Thus goes the world, or rather, thus it went in the seventeenth century.

The besieged, seeing that the enemy gave no signs of retreat, opened a window which looked out upon the churchyard, and cried, “Help, help!” The moon shone brightly—every object could be clearly discerned as in the day; but a deep repose rested over all—there was no indication of a living soul. Contiguous to the church, and on that side of it which fronted the parsonage, was a small habitation in which slept the sexton. Aroused by this strange outcry, he jumped from his bed, opened the small window, with his eyelids glued together all the time, and cried, “What is the matter?”

“Run, Ambrose, run! help! people in the house!” cried Don Abbondio. “I come in a moment,” replied he, drawing in his head; he closed his curtain, and half stupid, and half affrighted, thought of an expedient to bring more help than had been required of him, without risking his own life in the contest, whatever it might be. He hastily took his breeches from the bed, and putting them under his arm, like an opera hat, ran to the belfry and pulled away lustily.

Ton, Ton, Ton; the peasant aroused, sat up in his bed; the boy, sleeping in the hay-loft, listened eagerly, and sprang on his feet; “What is the matter? What is it? Fire! Robbers!” Each woman entreated her husband not to stir, but to leave it to others: such as were cowards obeyed, whilst the inquisitive and courageous took their arms, and ran towards the noise.

Long before this, however, the alarm had been given to other personages of our story; the bravoes in one place; and Agnes and Perpetua in another. It is necessary to relate briefly how the former had been occupied, since we last took leave of them; those at the old house, and those at the inn. The latter, when they ascertained that the inhabitants of the village had retired to rest, and that the road was clear, went to the cottage of Lucy, and found that a perfect stillness reigned within. They then returned to the old house to give in their report to Signor Griso. He immediately put on a slouched hat, with a pilgrim's habit, and staff, saying, “Let us act as becometh soldiers; cautious, quiet, and attentive to orders.” Then leading the way, he, with his company, arrived at the cottage, by a route different from that taken by our poor cottagers. Griso kept the band a few steps off, went forward alone to explore, and seeing all deserted and quiet on the outside, he beckoned to two of them, ordered them to mount very carefully and quietly the wall which enclosed the court-yard, and to conceal themselves on the other side behind a thick fig-tree, which he had observed in the morning. That being done, he knocked gently at the door, with the intention to call himself a pilgrim, who had wandered from his way, and request shelter until the morning. No answer; he knocked again, louder; not a sound! He then called a third robber, made him also descend into the yard, with orders to unfasten the bolt on the inside, so that they might have free entrance. All was performed with the utmost caution, and the most complete success. Griso then called the rest, and made some of them conceal themselves by the side of those behind the fig-tree; he then opened the door very softly, placed two centinels on the inside of it, and advanced to the lower chamber. He knocked; he waited—and well might wait; he raised the latch; no one from within said, “Who is there?” Nothing could go on better. He then called the robbers from the fig-tree, and with them entered the room where he had in the morning so villanously received the loaf of bread. He drew out his flint, tinder-box, and matches, and striking a light, proceeded to the inner chamber; it was empty! He returned to the stairs, and listened; solitude and silence! He left two to keep watch below, and with the others carefully ascended the stairs, cursing in his heart the creaking of the steps. He reached the summit, pushed softly open the door of the first room, and listened if any one breathed or moved: no one! He advanced, shading his face with the lamp, and perceived a bed; it was made, and perfectly smooth, with the covering arranged in order on the bolster! He shrugged his shoulders, and returning to the company, made a sign to them, that he was going into the other room, and that they should remain quietly behind,—he did so, and had the same success; all deserted and quiet.

“What the devil's this?” said he aloud; “some traitorous dog has played the spy!” They then searched with less ceremony the rest of the house, putting every thing out of its place. Meanwhile those at the doorway heard a light step approaching in the street,—they kept very quiet, thinking it would pass on; but, behold! it stopped exactly in front of the cottage! It was Menico, who had come in haste from the convent, to warn Agnes and her daughter to escape from the house, and take refuge there, because—the because is already known. He was surprised to find the door unbolted, and entering with a vague sentiment of alarm, found himself seized by two ruffians, who said in a menacing tone, “Hush! be quiet, or you die!” He uttered a cry, at which one struck him a blow on the mouth, the other placed his hand on his sword to inspire him with fear. The boy trembled like a leaf, and did not attempt to stir; but all at once was heard the first sound of the bell, and immediately after, a thundering peel burst forth. “The wicked are always cowards,” says a Milanese proverb; alarmed at the sound, the bravoes let go in haste the arms of Menico, and fled away hastily to the old house, to join the main body of their comrades. Menico, finding himself free, also fled, by the way of the fields, towards the belfry, naturally supposing he would find some one there. As to the other villains above stairs, the terrible sound made the same impression on them; amazed and perplexed, they hit one against the other, in striving to find the nearest way to the door. Nevertheless, they were brave, and accustomed to confront any known danger; but here was something unusual, an undetermined peril, and they became panic-struck. It now required all the superiority of Griso to keep them together, so that there should be a retreat, and not a flight. He succeeded, however, in assembling them in the middle of the court-yard. “Halt, halt,” cried he, “pistols in hand, knives ready, all in order, and then we will march. Cowards! for shame! fall behind me, and keep together.” Reduced to order, they followed him in silence.

We will leave them, in order to give an account of Agnes and Perpetua, whom we left at the end of the little lane, engaged in conversation. Agnes had managed to draw the latter off to some distance, by dint of appearing to give great heed to her story, which she urged on by an occasional “Certainly; now I comprehend; that is plain; and then? and he? and you?” In the midst of an important part of her narrative, the deep silence of the night was broken by the cry of Don Abbondio for “help!” “Mercy! what is the matter?” cried Perpetua, and prepared to run.

“What is the matter? what is the matter?” cried Agnes, holding her by the gown.

“Mercy! did you not hear?” replied she, struggling to get free.

“What is the matter? what is the matter?” repeated Agnes, holding her firmly by the arm.

“Devil of a woman!” exclaimed Perpetua, still struggling. Then was heard at a distance the light scream of Menico.

“Mercy!” cried Agnes also, and they both ran at full speed; the sound of the bell, which now succeeded, spurred them on. Perpetua arrived first, and, behold, at the door, Tony, Jervase, Renzo, and Lucy, who had found the stairs, and, at the terrible sound of the bell, were flying to some place of safety.

“What is the matter? What is the matter?” demanded Perpetua, out of breath, of the brothers. They answered her with a violent push, and fled away. “And you! what are you here for?” said she then to Renzo and Lucy. They made no reply. She then ascended the stairs in haste, to seek her master. The two lovers (still lovers) stood before Agnes, who, alarmed and grieved, said, “Ah! you are here! How has it gone? Why did the bell ring?”

“Home, home!” said Renzo, “before the people gather.” But Menico now appeared running to meet them. He was out of breath, and hardly able to cry out, “Back! back! by the way of the convent. There is the devil at the house,” continued he, panting; “I saw him, I did; he was going to kill me. The Father Christopher says you must come quickly.—I saw him, I did.—I am glad I found you all here,—I will tell you all when we are safe off.”

Renzo, who was the most self-possessed of the party, thought it best to follow his advice. “Let us follow him,” said he, to the females. They silently obeyed, and the little company moved on. They hastily crossed the churchyard, passing through a private street, into the fields. They were not many paces distant, before the people began to collect, each one asking of his neighbour what was the matter, and no one being able to answer the question. The first that arrived ran to the door of the church: it was fastened. They then looked through a little window into the belfry, and demanded the cause of the alarm. When Ambrose heard a known voice, and knew, by the hum, that there was an assemblage of people without, he hastily slipped on that part of his dress which he had carried under his arm, and opened the church door.

“What is all this tumult? What is the matter? Where is it?”

“Where is it? Do you not know? Why, in the curate's house. Run, run.” They rushed in a crowd thither; looked,—listened. All was quiet. The street door was fastened; not a window open; not a sound within.

“Who is within there? Holla! holla! Signor Curate, Signor Curate!”

Don Abbondio, who, as soon as he was relieved by the flight of the invaders, had retired from the window, and closed it, was now quarrelling with Perpetua for leaving him to bear the brunt of the battle alone. When he heard himself called by name, by the people outside, he repented of the rashness which had produced this undesired result.

“What has happened? Who are they? Where are they? What have they done to you?” cried a hundred voices at a time.

“There is no one here now; I am much obliged to you.—Return to your houses.”

“But who has been here? Where have they gone? What has happened?”

“Bad people, bad people, who wander about in the night; but they have all fled.—Return to your houses. I thank you for your kindness.” So saying, he retired and shut the window. There was a general murmur of disappointment through the crowd. Some laughed, some swore, some shrugged up their shoulders and went home; but at this moment a person came running towards them, panting and breathless. He lived at the house opposite to the cottage of Lucy, and had witnessed from the window the alarm of the bravoes, when Griso endeavoured to collect them in the court-yard. When he recovered breath, he cried, “What do you do here, friends? The devil is not here, he is down at the house of Agnes Mondella. Armed people are in it. It seems they wish to murder a pilgrim; but who knows what the devil it is?”

“What! what! what!” And then began a tumultuous conversation. “Let us go. How many are there? How many are we? Who are they?—The constable! the constable!”

“I am here,” replied the constable, from the midst of the crowd, “I am here, but you must assist me; you must obey.—Quick;—where is the sexton? To the bell, to the bell. Quick; some one run to Lecco to ask for succour.—Come this way.” The tumult was great, and as they were about to depart for the cottage of Agnes, another messenger came flying, and exclaimed, “Run, friends;—robbers who are carrying off a pilgrim. They are already out of the village! On! on! this way.”

In obedience to this command they moved in a mass, without waiting the orders of their leader, towards the cottage of Lucy. While the army advances, many of those at the head of the column, slacken their pace, not unwilling to leave the post of honour to their more adventurous friends in the rear. The confused multitude at length reach the scene of action. The traces of recent invasion were manifest,—the door open, the bolts loosened, but the invaders, where were they? They entered the court, advanced into the house, and called loudly, “Agnes! Lucy! Pilgrim! Where is the pilgrim! Did Stephano dream that he saw him? No, no, Carlandrea saw him also. Hallo! Pilgrim! Agnes! Lucy! No reply! They have killed them! they have killed them!” There was then a proposition to follow the murderers, which would have been acceded to, had not a voice from the crowd cried out, that Agnes and Lucy were in safety in some house. Satisfied with this, they soon dispersed to their homes, to relate to their wives that which had happened. The next day, however, the constable being in his field, and, with his foot resting on his spade, meditating on the mysteries of the past night, was accosted by two men, much resembling, in their appearance, those whom Don Abbondio had encountered a few days before. They very unceremoniously forbade him to make a deposition of the events of the night before the magistrate, and, if questioned by any of the gossips of the villagers, to maintain a perfect silence on pain of death.

Our fugitives for a while continued their flight, rapidly and silently, utterly overwhelmed by the fatigue of their flight, by their late anxiety, by vexation and disappointment at their failure, and a confused apprehension of some future danger. As the sound of the bell died away on the ear, they slackened their pace. Agnes, gathering breath and courage, first broke the silence, by asking Renzo what had been done at the curate's? He related briefly his melancholy story. “And who,” said she to Menico, “was the devil in the house? What did you mean by that?” The boy narrated that of which he had been an eye-witness, and which imparted a mingled feeling of alarm and gratitude to the minds of his auditors,—alarm at the obstinacy of Don Roderick in pursuing his purpose, and gratitude that they had thus escaped his snares. They caressed affectionately the boy who had been placed in so great danger on their account: Renzo gave him a piece of money in addition to the new coin already promised, and desired him to say nothing of the message given him by Father Christopher. “Now, return home,” said Agnes, “because thy family will be anxious about thee: you have been a good boy; go home, and pray the Lord that we may soon meet again.” The boy obeyed, and our travellers advanced in silence. Lucy kept close to her mother, dexterously but gently declining the arm of her lover. She felt abashed, even in the midst of all this confusion, at having been so long and so familiarly alone with him, while expecting that a few moments longer would have seen her his wife: but this dream had vanished, and she felt most sensitively the apparent indelicacy of their situation. They at length reached the open space before the church of the convent. Renzo advanced towards the door, and pushed it gently. It opened, and they beheld, by the light of the moon, which then fell upon his pallid face and silvery beard, the form of Father Christopher, who was there in anxious expectation of their arrival. “God be thanked!” said he, as they entered. By his side stood a capuchin, whose office was that of sexton to the church, whom he had persuaded to leave the door half open, and to watch with him. He had been very unwilling to submit to this inconvenient and dangerous condescension, which it required all the authority of the holy father to overcome; but, perceiving who the company were, he could endure no longer. Taking the father aside, he whispered, to him, “But Father—Father—at night—in the church—with women—shut—the rules—but Father!——” “Omnia munda mundis,” replied he, turning meekly to Friar Fazio, and forgetting that he did not understand Latin. But this forgetfulness was exactly the most fortunate thing in the world. If the father had produced arguments, Friar Fazio would not have failed to oppose them; but these mysterious words, he concluded, must contain a solution of all his doubts. He acquiesced, saying, “Very well; you know more than I do.”

Father Christopher then turned to our little company, who were standing in suspense, by the light of a lamp which was flickering before the altar. “Children,” said he, “thank the Lord, who has preserved you from great peril. Perhaps at this moment——” and he entered into an explanation of the reasons which had induced him to send for them to the convent, little suspecting that they knew more than he did, and supposing that Menico had found them tranquil at their home, before the arrival of the robbers. No one undeceived him, not even Lucy, although suffering the keenest anguish at practising dissimulation with such a man; but it was a night of confusion and duplicity.

“Now,” continued he, “you perceive, my children, that this country is no longer safe for you. It is your country, I know; you were born here; you have wronged no one: but such is the will of God! It is a trial, children, support it with patience, with faith, without murmuring; and be assured, there will come a day, in which you will see the wisdom of all that now befalls you. I have procured you a refuge for a season, and I hope you will soon be able to return safely to your home; at all events, God will provide, and I his minister will faithfully exert myself to serve you, my poor persecuted children. You,” continued he, turning to the females, “can remain at ——. There you will be beyond danger, and yet not far from home; go to our convent in that place, ask for the superior, give him this letter, he will be to you another Friar Christopher. And thou, my Renzo, thou must place thyself in safety from the impetuosity of others, and your own. Carry this letter to Father Bonaventura, of Lodi, in our convent at the eastern gate of Milan; he will be to you a father, will advise you, and find you work, until you can return to live here tranquilly. Now, go to the border of the lake, near the mouth of the Bione” (a stream a short distance from the convent); “you will see there a small boat fastened; you must say, ‘A boat;’ you will be asked for whom, answer, ‘Saint Francis.’ The boatman will receive you, will take you to the other side, where you will find a carriage, which will conduct you to ——. If any one should ask how Father Christopher came to have at his disposal such means of transport by land and by water, he would show little knowledge of the power possessed by a capuchin who held the reputation of a saint.”

The charge of the houses remained to be thought of; the father received the keys of them; Agnes, on consigning hers, thought with a sigh, that there was no need of keys, the house was open, the devil had been there, and it was doubtful if there remained any thing to be cared for.

“Before you go,” said the father, “let us pray together to the Lord, that he may be with you in this journey, and always, and above all, that he may give you strength to submit cheerfully to that which he has ordained.” So saying, he knelt down; all did the same. Having prayed a few moments in silence, he pronounced with a low but distinct voice the following words: “We pray thee also for the wretched man who has brought us to this state. We should be unworthy of thy mercy if we did not earnestly solicit it for him: he has most need of it. We, in our sorrow, have the consolation of trusting in thee; we can still offer thee our supplications, with thankfulness. But he—he is an enemy to thee! Oh wretched man! He dares to strive against thee: have pity on him, O Lord! touch his heart, soften his rebellious will, and bestow on him all the good we would desire for ourselves.”

Rising hastily, he then said, “Away, my children, there is no time to lose; God will go with you, his angel protect you: away.” They kept silence from emotion, and as they departed, the father added, “My heart tells me we shall soon meet again.” Without waiting for a reply, he retired; the travellers pursued their way to the appointed spot, found the boat, gave and received the watchword, and entered into it. The boatmen made silently for the opposite shore: there was not a breath of wind; the lake lay polished and smooth in the moonlight, agitated only by the dipping of the oars, which quivered in its gleam. The waves breaking on the sands of the shore, were heard deadly and slowly at a distance, mingled with the rippling of the waters between the pillars of the bridge.

The silent passengers cast a melancholy look behind at the mountains and the landscape, illumined by the moon, and varied by multitudes of shadows. They discerned villages, houses, cottages; the palace of Don Roderick, raised above the huts that crowded the base of the promontory, like a savage prowling in the dark over his slumbering prey. Lucy beheld it, and shuddered; then cast a glance beyond the declivity, towards her own little home, and beheld the top of the fig-tree which towered in the court-yard; moved at the sight, she buried her face in her hands, and wept in silence.

Farewell, ye mountains, source of waters! farewell to your varied summits, familiar as the faces of friends! ye torrents, whose voices have been heard from infancy! Farewell! how melancholy the destiny of one, who, bred up amid your scenes, bids you farewell! If voluntarily departing with the hope of future gain at this moment, the dream of wealth loses its attraction, his resolution falters, and he would fain remain with you, were it not for the hope of benefiting you by his prosperity. The more he advances into the level country, the more his view becomes wearied with its uniform extent; the air appears heavy and lifeless: he proceeds sorrowfully and thoughtfully into the tumultuous city; houses crowded against houses, street uniting with street, appears to deprive him of the power to breathe; and in front of edifices admired by strangers, he stops to recall, with restless desire, the image of the field and the cottage which had long been the object of his wishes, and which, on his return to his mountains, he will make his own, should he acquire the wealth of which he is in pursuit.

But how much more sorrowful the moment of separation to him, who, having never sent a transient wish beyond the mountains, feels that they comprise the limit of his earthly hopes, and yet is driven from them by an adverse fate; who is compelled to quit them to go into a foreign land, with scarcely a hope of return! Then he breaks forth into mournful exclamations. “Farewell native cottage! where, many a time and oft, I have listened with eager ear, to distinguish, amidst the rumour of footsteps, the well-known sound of those long expected and anxiously desired. Farewell, ye scenes, where I had hoped to pass, tranquil and content, the remnant of my days! Farewell, thou sanctuary of God, where my soul has been filled with admiring thoughts of him, and my voice has united with others to sing his praise! Farewell! He, whom I worshipped within your walls, is not confined to temples made with hands; heaven is his dwelling place, and the earth his footstool; he watches over his children, and, if he chastises them, it is in love, to prepare them for higher and holier enjoyments.”

Of such a nature, if not precisely the same, were the reflections of Lucy and her companions, as the bark carried them to the right bank of the Adda.
CHAPTER IX.

The shock which the boat received, as it struck against the shore, aroused Lucy from her reverie; they quitted the bark, and Renzo turned to thank and reward the boatman. “I will take nothing—nothing,” said he: “we are placed on earth to aid one another.” The carriage was ready, the driver seated; its expected occupants took their places, and the horses moved briskly on. Our travellers arrived then at Monza, which we believe to have been the name of the place to which Father Christopher had directed Renzo, a little after sunrise. The driver turned to an inn, where he appeared to be well acquainted, and demanded for them a separate room. He, as well as the boatman, refused the offered recompence of Renzo; like the boatman, he had in view a reward, more distant indeed, but more abundant; he withdrew his hand, and hastened to look after his beast.

After an evening such as we have described, and a night passed in painful thoughts both in regard to recent events and future anticipations—disturbed, indeed, by the frequent joltings of their incommodious vehicle,—our travellers felt a little rest in their retired apartment at the inn highly necessary. They partook of a small meal together, not more in proportion to the prevailing want, than to their own slender appetites; and recurred with a sigh to the delightful festivities, which, two days before, were to have accompanied their happy union. Renzo would willingly have remained with his companions all the day, to secure their lodging and perform other little offices. But they strongly alleged the injunctions of Father Christopher, together with the gossiping to which their continuing together would give rise, so that he at length acquiesced. Lucy could not conceal her tears; Renzo with difficulty restrained his; and, warmly pressing the hand of Agnes, he pronounced with a voice almost choked, “Till we meet again.”

The mother and daughter would have been in great perplexity, had it not been for the kind driver, who had orders to conduct them to the convent, which was at a little distance from the village. Upon their arrival there, the guide requested the porter to call the superior: he appeared, and the letter of Father Christopher was delivered to him. “Oh, from Father Christopher!” said he, recognising the handwriting. His voice and manner told evidently that he uttered the name of one whom he regarded as a particular friend. During the perusal of the letter, he manifested much surprise and indignation, and, raising his eyes, fixed them on Lucy and her mother with an expression of pity and interest. When he had finished reading, he remained for a moment thoughtful, and then exclaimed, “There is no one but the signora; if the signora would take upon herself this obligation——” and then addressing them, “My friends,” said he, “I will make the effort, and I hope to find you a shelter, more than secure, more than honourable; so that God has provided for you in the best manner. Will you come with me?”

The females bowed reverently in assent; the friar continued, “Come with me, then, to the monastery of the signora. But keep yourselves a few steps distant, because there are people who delight to speak evil of others, and God knows how many fine stories might be told, if the superior of the convent was seen walking with a beautiful young woman—with women, I mean.”

So saying, he went on before: Lucy blushed; the guide looked at Agnes, who could not conceal a momentary smile; and they all three obeyed the command of the friar, and followed him at a distance. “Who is the signora?” said Agnes, addressing their conductor.

“The signora,” replied he, “is not a nun; that is, not a nun like the others. She is not the abbess, nor the prioress; for they say that she is one of the youngest of them; but she is from Adam's rib, and her ancestors were great people, who came from Spain; and they call her the signora, to signify that she is a great lady,—every one calls her so, because they say that in this monastery they have never had so noble a person; and her relations down at Milan are very powerful, and in Monza still more so; because her father is the first lord in the country; for which reason she can do as she pleases in the convent,—and moreover people abroad bear her a great respect, and if she undertakes a thing, she makes it succeed; and if this good father induces her to take you under her protection, you will be as safe as at the foot of the altar.”

When the superior arrived at the gate of the town, which was defended at that time by an old tower, and part of a dismantled castle, he stopped and looked back to see if they followed him—then advanced towards the monastery, and, remaining on the threshold, awaited their approach. The guide then took his leave, not without many thanks from Agnes and her daughter for his kindness and faithfulness. The superior led them to the portress's chamber, and went alone to make the request of the signora. After a few moments he re-appeared, and with a joyful countenance told them that she would grant them an interview: on their way, he gave them much advice concerning their deportment in her presence. “She is well disposed towards you,” said he, “and has the power to protect you. Be humble, and respectful; reply with frankness to the questions she will ask you, and when not questioned, be silent.”

They passed through a lower chamber, and advanced towards the parlour. Lucy, who had never been in a monastery before, looked around as she entered it for the signora; but there was no one there; in a few moments, however, she observed the friar approach a small window or grating, behind which she beheld a nun standing. She appeared about twenty-five years of age; her countenance at first sight produced an impression of beauty, but of beauty prematurely faded. A black veil hung in folds on either side of her face; below the veil a band of white linen encircled a forehead of different, but not inferior whiteness; another plaited band encompassed the face, and terminated under the chin in a neck handkerchief, or cape, which, extending over the shoulders, covered to the waist the folds of her black robe. But her forehead was contracted from time to time, as if by some painful emotion; now, her large black eye was fixed steadfastly on your face with an expression of haughty curiosity, then hastily bent down as if to discover some hidden thought; in certain moments an attentive observer would have deemed that they solicited affection, sympathy, and pity; at others, he would have received a transient revelation of hatred, matured by a cruel disposition; when motionless and inattentive, some would have imagined them to express haughty aversion, others would have suspected the labouring of concealed thought, the effort to overcome some secret feeling of her soul, which had more power over it than all surrounding objects. Her cheeks were delicately formed, but extremely pale and thin; her lips, hardly suffused with a feeble tinge of the rose, seemed to soften into the pallid hue of the cheeks; their movements, like those of her eyes, were sudden, animated, and full of expression and mystery. Her loftiness of stature was not apparent, owing to an habitual stoop; as well as to her rapid and irregular movements, little becoming a nun, or even a lady. In her dress itself there was an appearance of studied neglect, which announced a singular character; and from the band around her temples was suffered to escape, through forgetfulness or contempt of the rules which prohibited it, a curl of glossy black hair.

These things made no impression on the minds of Agnes and Lucy, unaccustomed as they were to the sight of a nun; and to the superior it was no novelty—he, as well as many others, had become familiarised to her habit and manners.

She was, as we have said, standing near the grate, against which she leaned languidly, to observe those who were approaching. “Reverend mother, and most illustrious lady,” said the superior, bending low, “this is the poor young woman for whom I have solicited your protection, and this is her mother.”

Both mother and daughter bowed reverently. “It is fortunate that I have it in my power,” said she, turning to the father, “to do some little service to our good friends the capuchin fathers. But tell me a little more particularly, the situation of this young woman, that I may be better prepared to act for her advantage.”

Lucy blushed, and held down her head. “You must know, reverend mother,” said Agnes—but the father interrupted her;—“This young person, most illustrious lady,” continued he, “has been recommended to me, as I have told you, by one of my brethren. She has been obliged to depart secretly from her native place, in order to escape heavy perils; and she has need for some time of an asylum, where she can remain unknown, and where no one will dare to molest her.”

“What perils?” demanded the lady. “Pray, father, do not talk so enigmatically: you know, we nuns like to hear stories minutely.”

“They are perils,” replied the father, “that should not be told to the pure ears of the reverend mother.”—“Oh, certainly,” said the lady, hastily, and slightly blushing. Was this the blush of modesty? He would have doubted it, who should have observed the rapid expression of disdain which accompanied it, or have compared it with that which from time to time diffused itself over the cheek of Lucy.

“It is sufficient to say,” resumed the friar, “that a powerful lord—it is not all the rich and noble who make use of the gifts of God for the promotion of his glory, as you do, most illustrious lady—a powerful lord, after having persecuted for a long time this innocent creature with wicked allurements, finding them unavailing, has had recourse to open force, so that she has been obliged to fly from her home.”

“Approach, young woman,” said the signora. “I know that the father is truth itself; but no one can be better informed than you with regard to this affair. To you it belongs to tell us if this lord was an odious persecutor.” Lucy obeyed the first command, and approached the grating; but the second, accompanied as it was with a certain malicious air of doubt, brought a blush over her countenance, and a sense of painful embarrassment, which she found it impossible to overcome. “Lady——mother——reverend——” stammered she. Agnes now felt herself authorised to come to her assistance. “Most illustrious lady,” said she, “I can bear testimony that my daughter hates this lord as the devil hates holy water. I would call him the devil, were it not for your reverend presence. The case is this: this poor maiden was promised to a good and industrious youth; and if the curate had done his duty——”

“You are very ready to speak without being interrogated,” interrupted the lady, with an expression of anger on her countenance, which changed it almost to deformity. “Silence; I have not to be informed that parents have always an answer prepared in the name of their children.”

Agnes drew back mortified, and the father guardian signified to Lucy by a look, as well as by a movement of the head, that now was the time to rouse her courage, and not leave her poor mother in the dilemma. “Reverend lady,” said she, “what my mother has told you is the truth. I willingly engaged myself to the poor youth (and here she became covered with blushes)——  Pardon me this boldness; but I would not have you think ill of my mother. And as to this lord (God forgive him!) I would rather die than fall into his hands. And if you do this deed of charity, be certain, signora, none will pray for you more heartily than those whom you have thus sheltered.”

“I believe you,” said the lady, with a softened voice; “but we will see you alone. Not that I need farther explanation, nor other motives to accede to the wishes of the father superior,” added she, turning to him with studied politeness. “Nay,” continued she, “I have been thinking, and this is what has occurred to me. The portress of the monastery has bestowed in marriage, a few days since, her last daughter; these females can occupy her room, and supply her place in the little services which it was her office to perform.”

The father would have expressed his thanks, but the lady interrupted him. “There is no need of ceremony; in case of need, I would not hesitate to ask assistance of the capuchin fathers. In short,” continued she, with a smile, in which appeared a degree of bitter irony, “are we not brothers and sisters?”

So saying, she called a nun, her attendant (by a singular distinction she had two assigned for her private service), and sent her to inform the abbess; she then called the portress, and made with her and Agnes the necessary arrangements. Then taking leave of the superior, she dismissed Agnes to her room, but retained Lucy. The signora, who, in presence of a capuchin, had studied her actions and her words, thought no longer of putting a restraint on them before an inexperienced country girl. Her discourse became by degrees so strange, that, in order to account for it, we will relate the previous history of this unhappy and misguided person.

She was the youngest daughter of the Prince ***, a great Milanese nobleman, who was among the wealthiest of the city. The magnificent ideas he entertained of his rank, made him suppose his wealth hardly sufficient to support it properly; he therefore determined to preserve his riches with the greatest care. How many children he had does not clearly appear; it is only known that he had destined to the cloister all the youngest of both sexes, in order to preserve his fortune for the eldest son. The condition of the unhappy signora had been settled even before her birth; it remained only to be decided whether she were to be a monk or a nun. At her birth, the prince her father, wishing to give her a name which could recall at every moment the idea of a cloister, and which had been borne by a saint of a noble family, called her Gertrude. Dolls, clothed like nuns, were the first toys that were put into her hands; then pictures of nuns; and these gifts were accompanied with many injunctions to be careful of them, for they were precious things. When the prince or princess, or the young prince, who was the only one of the children brought up at home, wished to praise the beauty of the infant, they found no way of expressing their ideas, except in exclamations of this sort, “What a mother abbess!” But no one ever said directly to her, “Thou must be a nun;” such an intention, however, was understood, and included in every conversation regarding her future destiny. If, sometimes, the little Gertrude betrayed perversity and impetuosity of temper, they would say to her, “Thou art but a child, and these manners are not becoming: wait till thou art the mother abbess, and then thou shalt command with a rod; thou shalt do whatever pleases thee.” At other times, reprehending her for the freedom and familiarity of her manners, the prince would say, “Such should not be the deportment of one like you; if you wish at some future day to have the respect of all around you, learn now to have more gravity; remember that you will be the first in the monastery, because noble blood bears sway every where.”

By such conversations as these the implicit idea was produced in the mind of the child, that she was to be a nun. The manners of the prince were habitually austere and repulsive; and, with respect to the destination of the child, his resolution appeared fixed as fate. At six years of age she was placed for her education in the monastery where we find her: her father, being the most powerful noble in Monza, enjoyed there great authority; and his daughter, consequently, would receive those distinctions, with those allurements, which might lead her to select it for her perpetual abode. The abbess and nuns, rejoicing at the acquisition of such powerful friendship, received with great gratitude the honour conferred in preference on them, and entered with avidity into the views of the prince; Gertrude experienced all sorts of favours and indulgences, and, child as she was, the respectful attention of the nuns towards her was exercised with the same deference as if she had been the abbess herself! Not that they were all pledged to draw the poor child into the snare; many acted with simplicity, and through tenderness, merely following the example of those around them; if the suspicions of others were excited, they kept silence, so as not to cause useless disturbance; some, indeed, more discriminating and compassionate, pitied the poor child as being the object of artifices, to the like of which they themselves had been the victims.

Things would have proceeded agreeably to the wishes of all concerned, had Gertrude been the only child in the monastery; but this was not the case; and there were some among her school companions who were destined for the matrimonial state. The little Gertrude, filled with the idea of her superiority, spoke proudly of her future destiny, expecting thereby to excite their envy at her peculiar honours: with scorn and wonder she perceived that their estimation of them was very different. To the majestic but circumscribed and cold images of the power of an abbess, they opposed the varied and bright pictures of husband, guests, cities, tournaments, courts, dress, and equipage. New and strange emotions arose in the mind of Gertrude: her vanity had been cultivated in order to make the cloister desirable to her; and now, easily assimilating itself with the ideas thus presented, she entered into them with all the ardour of her soul. She replied, that no one could oblige her to take the veil, without her own consent; that she could also marry, inhabit a palace, and enjoy the world; that she could if she wished it; that she would wish it, and did wish it. The necessity of her own consent, hitherto little considered, became henceforth the ruling thought of her mind; she called it to her aid, at all times, when she desired to luxuriate in the pleasing images of future felicity.

But her fancied enjoyment was impaired by the reflection, which at such moments intruded itself, that her father had irrevocably decided her destiny; and she shuddered at the recollection of his austere manners, which impressed upon all around him the sentiments of a fatal necessity as being necessarily conjoined with whatever he should command. Then would she compare her condition to that of her more fortunate companions; and envy soon grew into hatred. This would manifest itself by a display of present superiority, and sometimes of ill-nature, sarcasm, and spite; at other times her more amiable and gentle qualities would obtain a transitory ascendency. Thus she passed the period allotted for her education, in dreams of future bliss, mingled with the dread of future misery. That which she anticipated most distinctly, was external pomp and splendour; and her fancy would often luxuriate in imaginary scenes of grandeur, constructed out of such materials as her memory could faintly and confusedly furnish forth, and the descriptions of her companions supply. There were moments when these brilliant imaginings were disturbed by the idea of religion; but the religion which had been inculcated to the poor girl did not proscribe pride, but, on the contrary, sanctified it, and proposed it as a means of obtaining terrestrial felicity. Thus despoiled of its essence, it was no longer religion, but a phantom, which, assuming at times a power over her mind, the unhappy girl was tormented with superstitious dread, and, filled with a confused idea of duties, imagined her repugnance to the cloister to be a crime, which could only be expiated by her voluntary dedication.

There was a law, that no young person could be accepted for the monastic life, without being examined by an ecclesiastic, called the vicar of the nuns, so that it should be made manifest that it was the result of her free election; and this examination could not take place until a year after she had presented her petition for admission, in writing, to the vicar. The nuns, therefore, who were aware of the projects of her father, undertook to draw from her such a petition; encountering her in one of those moments, when she was assailed by her superstitious fears, they suggested to her the propriety of such a course, and assured her, nevertheless, that it was a mere formality (which was true), and would be without efficacy, unless sanctioned by some after-act of her own. The petition, however, had scarcely been sent to its destination, when Gertrude repented of having written it; she then repented of this repentance, passing months in incessant vicissitude of feeling. There was another law, that, at this examination, a young person should not be received, without having remained at least a month at her paternal home. A year had nearly passed since the petition had been sent, and Gertrude had been warned that she would soon be removed from the monastery, and conducted to her father's house, to take the final steps towards the consummation of that which they held certain. Not so the poor girl; her mind was busied with plans of escape: in her perplexity, she unbosomed herself to one of her companions, who counselled her to inform her father by letter of the change in her views. The letter was written and sent; Gertrude remained in great anxiety, expecting a reply, which never came. A few days after, the abbess took her aside, and, with a mixed expression of contempt and compassion, hinted to her the anger of the prince, and the error she had committed; but that, if she conducted herself well for the future, all would be forgotten. The poor girl heard, and dared not ask farther explanation.

The day, so ardently desired and so greatly feared, came at last. The anticipation of the trials that awaited her was forgotten in her tumultuous joy at the sight of the open country, the city, and the houses. She might well feel thus, after having been for eight years enclosed within the walls of the monastery! She had previously arranged with her new confidant the part she was to act. Oh! they will try to force me, thought she: but I will persist, humbly and respectfully; the point is, not to say Yes; and I will not say it. Or, perhaps they will endeavour to shake my purpose by kindness: but I will weep, I will implore, I will excite their compassion, I will beseech them not to sacrifice me. But none of her anticipations were verified: her parents and family, with the usual artful policy in such cases, maintained a perfect silence with regard to the subject of her meditations; they regarded her with looks of contemptuous pity, and appeared to avoid all conversation with her, as if she had rendered herself unworthy of it. A mysterious anathema appeared to hang over her, and to keep at a distance every member of the household. If, wearied with this proscription, she endeavoured to enter into conversation, they made her understand indirectly, that by obedience alone could she regain the affections of the family. But this was precisely the condition to which she could not assent: she therefore continued in her state of excommunication, which unhappily appeared to be, at least partially, the consequence of her own conduct.

Such a state of things formed a sad contrast to the radiant visions which had occupied her imagination. Her confinement was as strict at home as it had been in the monastery; and she, who had fancied she should enjoy, at least for this brief period, the pleasures of the world, found herself an exile from all society. At every announcement of a visiter, she was compelled to retire with the elderly persons of the family; and always dined apart whenever a guest was present. Even the servants of the family appeared to concur with the designs of their master, and to treat her with carelessness, ill concealed by an awkward attempt at formality. There was one among them, however, who seemed to feel towards her respect and compassion. This was a handsome page, who equalled, in her imagination, the ideal images of loveliness she had so often fondly cherished. There was soon apparent a change in her manner, a love of reverie and abstraction, and she no longer appeared to covet the favour of her family; some engrossing thought had taken possession of her mind. To be brief, she was detected one day in folding a letter, which it had been better she had not written, and which she was obliged to relinquish to her female attendant, who carried it to the prince, her father. He came immediately to her apartment with the letter in his hand, and in few but terrible words told her, that for the present she should be confined to her chamber, with the society only of the woman who had made the discovery; and intimated for the future still darker punishments. The page was dismissed, with an imperative command of silence, and solemn threatenings of punishment should he presume to violate it. Gertrude was then left alone, with her shame, her remorse, and her terror; and the sole company of this woman, whom she hated, as the witness of her fault, and the cause of her disgrace. The hatred was cordially returned, inasmuch as the attendant found herself reduced to the annoying duty of a jailer, and was made the guardian of a perilous secret for life. The first confused tumult of her feelings having in some measure subsided, she recalled to mind the dark intimations of her father with regard to some future punishment: what could this be? It most probably was a return to the monastery at Monza, not as the signorina, but as a guilty wretch, who, loaded with shame, was to be inclosed within its walls for ever! Now, indeed, her fancy no longer dwelt on the bright visions with which it had been so often busied; they were too much opposed to the sad reality of her present condition. Such an act would repair all her errors, and change (could she doubt it) in an instant her condition. The only castle in which Gertrude could imagine a tranquil and honourable asylum, and which was not in the air, was the monastery, in which she now resolved to place herself for ever! Opposed to this resolution rose up the contemplations of many years past: but times were changed, and to the depth in which Gertrude had fallen, the condition of a nun, revered, obeyed, and feared, formed a bright contrast. She was perpetually tormented also by her jailer, who, to revenge herself for the confinement imposed on her, failed not to taunt her for her misdemeanor, and to repeat the menaces of her father; or whenever she seemed disposed to relent, and to show something like pity, her tone of protection was still more intolerable. The predominant desire of Gertrude was to escape from her clutches, and to raise herself to a condition above her anger or her pity. At the end of four or five long days, with her patience exhausted by the bitter railings of her keeper, she sat herself down in a corner of the chamber, and covering her face with her hands, wept in bitterness of soul. She experienced an absolute craving for other faces and other sounds than those of her tormentor; and a sudden joy imparted itself to her mind, from the reflection, that it depended only on herself to be restored to the good-will and attentions of the family. Mingled with this joy, came repentance for her fault, and a desire to expiate it. She arose, went to a small table, and taking a pen, wrote to her father, expressing her penitence and her hope, imploring his pardon, and promising to do all that might be required of her.
CHAPTER X.

There are moments in which the mind, particularly of the young, is so disposed, that a little importunity suffices to obtain from it any thing that has the appearance of virtuous sacrifice; as a flower scarcely budded abandons itself on its fragile stem, ready to yield its sweets to the first breeze which plays around it. These moments, which ought to be regarded by others with timid respect, are exactly those of which interested cunning makes use, to insnare the unguarded will.

On the perusal of this letter, the prince saw the way opened to the furtherance of his views. He sent for Gertrude; she obeyed the command, and, in his presence, threw herself at his feet, and had scarcely power to exclaim, “Pardon!” He made a sign to her to rise, and in a grave voice answered, that it was not enough merely to confess her fault, and ask forgiveness, but that it was necessary to merit it. Gertrude asked submissively, “what he would have her do?” To this the prince did not reply directly, but spoke at length of the fault of Gertrude: the poor girl shuddered as at the touch of a hand on a severe wound. He continued, that even if he had entertained the project of settling her in the world, she had herself placed an insuperable obstacle to it; since he could never, as a gentleman of honour, permit her to marry, after having given such a specimen of herself. The miserable listener was completely humbled!

The prince, then, by degrees softened his voice and manner to say, that for all faults there was a remedy, and that the remedy for hers was clearly indicated; that she might perceive, in this fatal accident, a warning that the world was too full of dangers for her——

“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Gertrude, overwhelmed with shame and remorse.

“Ah, you perceive it yourself!” resumed the prince. “Well, we will speak no more of the past; all is forgotten. You have taken the only honourable way that remains for you; and because you have taken it voluntarily, it rests with me to make it turn to your advantage, and to make the merit of the sacrifice all your own.” So saying, he rang the bell, and said to the servant who appeared, “The princess and the prince immediately.” He continued to Gertrude, “I wish to make them the sharers of my joy; I wish that they should begin at once to treat you as you deserve. You have hitherto found me a severe judge; you shall now prove that I am a loving father.”

At these words Gertrude remained stupified; she thought of the “yes” she had so precipitately suffered to escape from her lips, and would have recalled it; but she did not dare; the satisfaction of the prince appeared so entire, his condescension so conditional, that she could not presume to utter a word to disturb it.

The princess and prince came into the room. On seeing Gertrude there, they appeared full of doubt and surprise; but the prince, with a joyful countenance, said to them, “Behold here the lost sheep! and let these be the last words that shall recall painful recollections. Behold the consolation of the family! Gertrude has no longer need of advice; she has voluntarily chosen her own good. She has resolved, she has signified to me that she has resolved——” She raised to him a look of supplication, but he continued more plainly, “that she has resolved to take the veil.”

“Well done, well done,” exclaimed they both, overwhelming her with embraces, which Gertrude received with tears, which they chose to interpret as tears of joy. Then the prince enlarged on the splendid destiny of his daughter, on the distinction she would enjoy in the monastery and in the country, as the representative of the family. Her mother and her brother renewed their congratulations and praises. Gertrude stood as if possessed by a dream.

It was then necessary to fix the day for the journey to Monza, for the purpose of making the request of the abbess. “How rejoiced she will be!” said the prince; “I am sure all the nuns will appreciate the honour Gertrude does them. But why not go there to-day? Gertrude will willingly take the air.”

“Let us go, then,” said the princess.

“I will order the carriage,” said the young prince.

“But——” said Gertrude submissively.

“Softly, softly,” said the prince, “let her decide; perhaps she does not feel disposed to go to-day, and would rather wait until to-morrow. Say, do you wish to go to-day or to-morrow?”

“To-morrow,” said Gertrude, in a feeble voice, glad of a short reprieve.

“To-morrow,” said the prince, solemnly; “she has decided to go to-morrow. Meanwhile I will see the vicar of the nuns, to have him to appoint a day for the examination.” He did so, and the vicar named the day after the next. In the interval Gertrude was not left a moment to herself. She would have desired some repose for her mind after so many contending emotions; to have reflected on the step she had already taken, and what remained to be done—but the machine once in motion at her direction, it was no longer in her power to arrest its progress; occupations succeeded each other without interruption. The princess herself assisted at her toilette, which was completed by her own maid. This effected, dinner was announced, and poor Gertrude was made to pass through the crowd of servants, who nodded their congratulations to each other. She found at the table a few relations of the family, who had been invited in haste to participate in the general joy. The young bride—thus they called young persons about to enter the monastic life—the young bride had enough to do to reply to the compliments which were paid to her; she felt that each reply was a confirmation of her destiny; but how act differently? After dinner came the hour of riding, and Gertrude was placed in a carriage with her mother and two uncles, who had been among the guests. They entered the street Marina, which then crossed the space now occupied by the public gardens, and was the public promenade, where the nobility refreshed themselves after the fatigues of the day. The uncles conversed much with Gertrude, and one of them in particular, who appeared to know every body, every carriage, and every livery, had something to tell of signor such an one, and signora such an one; but checking himself, he said to his niece, “Ah! you little rogue! you turn your back upon all these follies; you are the righteous person; you leave us worldlings far behind; you are going to lead a happy life, and take yourself to paradise in a coach.”

They returned home in the dusk of the evening, and the servants, appearing with torches, announced to them that numerous visiters had arrived. The report had spread, and a multitude of relations and friends had come to offer their congratulations. The young bride was the idol, the amusement, the victim of the evening. Finally, Gertrude was left alone with the family. “At last,” said the prince, “I have had the consolation of seeing my daughter in society becoming her rank and station. She has conducted herself admirably, and has evinced that there will be no preventive to her obtaining the highest honours, and supporting the dignity of the family.” They supped hastily, so as to be ready early in the morning.

At the request of Gertrude, her attendant, of whose insolence she bitterly complained to her father, was removed, and another placed in her stead. This was an old woman, who had been nurse to the young prince, in whom was centred all her hopes and her pride. She was overjoyed at the decision of Gertrude, who, as a climax to her trials, was obliged to listen to her congratulations and praises. She talked of her numerous aunts and relatives, who were so happy as nuns; of the many visits she would doubtless receive. She further spoke of the young prince, and the lady who was to be his wife, and the visit which they would doubtless pay to Gertrude at the monastery, until, wearied out with the conflicts of the day, the poor girl fell asleep. She was aroused in the morning by the harsh voice of the old woman, “Up, up, signora, young bride! it is day; the princess is up, and waiting for you. The young prince is impatient. He is as brisk as a hare, the young devil; he was so from an infant. But when he is ready, you must not make him wait; he is the best temper in the world, but that always makes him impatient and noisy. Poor fellow, we must pity him, it is the effect of temperament; in such moments he has respect to no one but the head of the household; however, one day he will be the head; may that day be far off! Quick, quick, signorina! You should have been out of your nest before this.”

The idea of the young prince, risen and impatient, recalled the scattered thoughts of Gertrude, and hastily she suffered herself to be dressed, and descended to the saloon, where her parents and brother were assembled. A cup of chocolate was brought her, and the carriage was announced. Before their departure, the prince took his daughter aside, and said to her, “Courage, Gertrude; yesterday you did well, to-day you must excel yourself; the point is now to make a suitable appearance in the country and in the monastery, where you are destined to hold the first station. They expect you, and all eyes will be on you. Dignity and ease. The abbess will ask you what is your request; it is a mere form, but you must reply that you wish to be admitted to take the veil in this monastery, where you have been educated, and treated so kindly; which is the truth. Speak these words with a free unembarrassed air, so as not to give occasion for scandal. These good mothers know nothing of the unhappy occurrence; that must remain buried with the family. However, an anxious countenance might excite suspicion; show whose is the blood in your veins; be polite and modest; but remember also, that in this country, out of the family, there is none your superior.”

During their ride, the troubles and the trials of the world, and the blessed life of the cloister, were the principal subjects of conversation. As they approached the monastery, the crowd collected from all parts; as the carriage stopped before the walls, the heart of Gertrude beat more rapidly: they alighted amidst the concourse; all eyes were fastened on her, and compelled her to study the movements of her countenance; and, above all, those of her father, upon whom she could not help fixing her regards, notwithstanding the fear he inspired. They crossed the first court, entered the second, and here appeared the interior cloister, wide open, and occupied by nuns. In front was the abbess, surrounded by the most aged of the sisterhood; behind these the others, raised promiscuously on tiptoe, and farther back the lay sisters, standing on benches and overlooking the scene; whilst here and there were seen, peeping between the cowls, some youthful faces, which Gertrude recognised as those of her school companions. As she stood fronting the abbess, the latter demanded, with grave solemnity, “What she desired to have in this place, where nothing could be denied her?”

“I am here,” began Gertrude; but, about to utter the words which were to decide her destiny irrevocably, she felt her heart fail, and hesitating, she fixed her eyes on the crowd before her. She beheld there the well-known face of one of her companions, who regarded her with looks of compassion and malice, as if to say, “They have caught the brave one.” This sight required all her courage, and she was about to give a reply very different from that which was expected from her, when, glancing at her father, she caught from his eye such an anxious and threatening expression, that, overcome by terror, she proceeded, “I am here to ask admittance into this monastery, where I have been instructed so kindly.” The abbess immediately expressed her regret, that the regulations were such as to prohibit an immediate answer, which must be given by the common suffrage of the sisterhood; but that Gertrude knew well the sentiments they entertained towards her; and might judge what that answer would be. In the mean time nothing prevented them from manifesting their joy at her request. There was then heard a confused murmur of congratulations and rejoicing.

Whilst the nuns were surrounding their new companion, and offering their congratulations to all the party, the abbess expressed her wish to address a few words to the prince at the parlour grating.

“Signor,” said she, “in obedience to our rules—to fulfil a necessary form—I must inform you—that whenever a young person desires to assume—the superior, which I am, though unworthily, is obliged to make known to the parents that if—they have forced the will of their daughter, they will incur the pains of excommunication. You will excuse——”

“Oh! yes, yes, reverend mother. Your exactitude is very praiseworthy, very just. But you cannot doubt——”

“Oh! imagine, prince, if—but I merely speak by order; besides——”

“True—true, reverend mother.”

After these few words, and a renewal of compliments and thanks, they departed.

Gertrude was silent during their ride; overcome and occupied by conflicting thoughts, ashamed of her own want of resolution, vexed with others as well as herself, she was still meditating some way of escape, but every time she looked at her father, she felt her destiny to be irrevocable. After the various engagements of the day were over,—the dinner, the visits, the drive, the conversazione, the supper,—the prince brought another subject under discussion, which was the choice of a godmother (so they called the lady who is selected as chaperone to the young candidate in the interval between the request for admission, and the putting on of the habit); the duty of this person was to visit, with her charge, the churches, public palaces, the conversazioni, in short, every thing of note in the city and its environs; so as to afford a peep at that world they were about to quit for ever. “We must think of a godmother,” said the prince, “because to-morrow the vicar of the nuns will be here for the examination, and soon after that, Gertrude will be finally accepted. Now the choice shall come from Gertrude herself, although contrary to usage; but she deserves to be made an exception, and we may confidently trust to her judgment in the selection.” And then, turning to her, as if bestowing a singular favour, he continued, “Any one of the ladies who were at the conversazione this evening, possesses the necessary qualifications for a godmother; any one of them will consider it an honour; make your selection.” Gertrude instantly felt that the choice would be a renewal of consent; but the proposal was made with such an air of condescension, that a refusal would have appeared to spring from contempt or ingratitude. Thus she took another step, and named a lady who had been forward in attentions to her during the whole evening. “A perfectly wise choice,” said the prince, who had expected no less. The affair had all been previously arranged; this lady had been so much with Gertrude at the conversazione, and had displayed such kindness of manner, that it would have been an effort for her to think of another. The attentions, however, of this lady were not without their object: she had also for a long time contemplated making the young prince her son; she, therefore, naturally interested herself in all that concerned the family, and felt the deepest interest in her dear Gertrude.

On the morrow, the imagination of Gertrude was occupied with the expected examination, and with a vague hope of some opportunity to retract. At an early hour she was sent for by the prince, who addressed her in these words:—“Courage, my daughter; you have as yet conducted yourself admirably; to-day you must crown the work. All that has been done, has been done with your consent. If, in the meanwhile, you had any doubts, any misgivings, you should have expressed them; but at the point to which things have now arrived, it will no longer do to play the child. The worthy man who is to come this morning, will put a hundred questions to you, concerning your vocation; such as, whether you go voluntarily, and the why and the wherefore. If you falter in your replies, he will continue to urge you; this will produce pain to yourself, but might become the source of a more serious evil. After all the public demonstrations that we have made, the slightest hesitation on your part might place my honour in danger, by conveying the idea that I had taken a mere youthful whim for a confirmed resolution, and that I had thus acted precipitately; in this case, I should feel myself under the necessity, in order to preserve my character inviolate, to reveal the true motive——” But, seeing the countenance of Gertrude all on flame, and contracting itself like the leaves of a flower in the heat which precedes a tempest, he stopped a moment, and then resumed, “Well, well, all depends on yourself. I know you will not show yourself a child; but recollect, you must reply with freedom, so as not to create suspicion in the mind of this worthy man.” He then suggested the answers to be made to the probable questions that would be put, and concluded with various remarks upon the happiness that awaited Gertrude at the convent. At this moment the servant announced the arrival of the vicar, and the prince was obliged to leave his daughter alone to receive him.

The good man had come with a preconceived opinion that Gertrude went voluntarily to the cloister, because the prince had told him so. It was one of his maxims, however, to preserve himself unprejudiced, and to depend only on the assertions of the candidates themselves. “Signorina,” said he, “I come to play the part of the tempter; I come to suggest doubts where you have affirmed certainties; I come to place before your eyes difficulties, and ascertain if you have well considered them. You will allow me to trouble you with some interrogatories?”

“Say on,” replied Gertrude.

The good priest then began to interrogate her in the form prescribed. “Do you feel in your heart a free spontaneous resolution to become a nun? Have menaces, or allurements, or authority been made use of? Speak without reserve to one whose duty it is to ascertain the true state of your feelings, and to prevent violence being done to them.”

The true reply to such a question presented itself suddenly to the mind of Gertrude, with terrible reality. But to come to an explanation, to say she was threatened, to relate the unfortunate story—from this her spirit shrank, and she brought herself to the resolution of saying, “I become a nun, freely, from inclination.”

“How long have you had this intention?” asked the good priest.

“I have always had it,” said Gertrude, finding it easier after the first step to proceed in falsehood.

“But what is the principal motive which has induced you?”

The interrogator was not aware of the chord he touched; and Gertrude, making a great effort to preserve the tranquillity of her countenance, amid the tumult of her soul, replied. “The motive is, to serve God, and to fly the perils of the world.”

“Has there never been any disgust? any—excuse me—caprice? Often trifling causes make impressions which we deem will be perpetual, but the causes cease——”

“No, no,” replied Gertrude, hastily; “the cause is that which I have said.”

The vicar, in order to execute his duty fully, persisted in his enquiries, but Gertrude was determined to deceive him. She could not for a moment think of rendering the good man acquainted with her weakness; she knew, indeed, that he could prevent her being a nun, but that this would be the extent of his authority and his protection. When he should be gone, she would still be left alone, to endure fresh trials from her father and the family. Finding, therefore, a uniform answer to all his questions, he became somewhat wearied of putting them, and, concluding that all was as it should be, with many prayers for her welfare, he took his leave. As he crossed the hall he met the prince, and congratulated him on the good dispositions of his daughter. This put an end to a very painful state of suspense and anxiety on the part of the prince; who, forgetting his usual gravity, ran to his daughter, and loaded her with praises, caresses, and promises, and with a tenderness of affection in great measure sincere: such is the inconsistency of the human heart.

Then ensued a round of spectacles and diversions, during which we cannot attempt to describe minutely or in order the emotions to which the heart of Gertrude was subjected. The perpetual change of objects, the freedom enjoyed by this change, rendered more odious to her the idea of her prison; still more pungent were the impressions she received in the festivals and assemblies of the city. The pomp of the palaces, the splendour of their furniture, the buzzing and festal clamour of the conversazione, communicated to her such an intoxication, such an eager desire for happiness, that she thought she could encounter all the consequences of a recantation, or even suffer death, rather than return to the cold shades of the cloister. But all such resolutions instantly fled as her eyes rested on the austere countenance of the prince.

Meanwhile, the vicar of the nuns had made the necessary deposition, and liberty was given to hold a chapter for the acceptation of Gertrude. The chapter was held, and she was received! Wearied out with her long conflicts, she requested immediate admittance, which was readily granted. After a noviciate of twelve days, full of resolves and counter-resolves, the moment arrived when she finally pronounced the fatal “yes,” which was to exclude her from the world for ever. But even in the depths of the monastery she found no repose; she had not the wisdom to make a virtue of necessity, but was continually and uselessly recurring to the past. She could not call religion to her aid, for religion had no share in the sacrifice she had made; and heavily and bitterly she bore the yoke of bondage. She hated the nuns, because she remembered their artifices, and regarded them in some measure as the authors of her misfortune; she tyrannised over them with impunity, because they dared not rebel against her authority, and incur the resentment of the powerful lord, her father. Those nuns who were really pious and harmless, she hated for their piety itself, as it seemed to cast a tacit reproach on her weakness; and she suffered no occasion to escape without railing at them as bigots and hypocrites. It might, however, have mitigated her asperity towards them, had she known that the black balls to oppose her entrance had been cast into the urn by their sympathetic generosity. She found, however, one consolation, in the unlimited power she possessed, in being courted and flattered, and in hearing herself called the “signora.” But what a consolation! Her soul felt its insufficiency, but had not the courage nor the virtue to seek happiness from the only source where it could be found. Thus she lived many years, tyrannising over and feared by all around her, till an occasion presented itself for a further developement of her habitual, but secret feelings. Among other privileges which had been accorded to her in the monastery, was that of having her apartments on a side of the building little frequented by the other nuns. Opposite to this quarter of the convent was a house, inhabited by a young man, a villain by profession, one of those who, at this period, by their mutual combinations were enabled to set at nought the public laws. His name was Egidio. From his small window, which overlooked the court-yard, he had often seen Gertrude wandering there from listlessness and melancholy. Allured rather than intimidated by the danger and iniquity of the act, he dared one day to speak to her. The wretched girl replied!

Then was experienced a new but not unmixed satisfaction; into the painful void of her soul was infused a powerful stimulus, a fresh principle of vitality: but this enjoyment resembled the restoring beverage which the ingenious cruelty of the ancients presented to the criminal, in order to strengthen him to sustain his martyrdom. A change came also over her whole deportment; she was regular, tranquil, endearing, and affable; in such a degree, that the sisters congratulated themselves upon the circumstance, little imagining the true motive, and that the alteration was none other than hypocrisy added to her other defects. This outward improvement, however, did not last long; she soon returned to her customary caprices, and, moreover, was heard to utter bitter imprecations against the cloistral prison, in unusual and unbecoming language. The sisters bore these vicissitudes as well as they could, and attributed them to the light and capricious nature of the signora. For some time it did not appear that the suspicions of any one of them were excited; but one day the signora had been speaking with one of the sisters, her attendant, and reviling her beyond measure for some trifling matter: the sister suffered a while, and gnawed the bit in silence; but finally, becoming impatient, declared that she was mistress of a secret, and could advise the signora in her turn. From this time forward her peace was lost. Not many days after, however, this very sister was missing from her accustomed offices; they sought her in her cell, and did not find her; they called, and she answered not; they searched diligently in every place, but without success. And who knows what conjectures might have arisen, if there had not been found a great opening in the wall of the orchard, through which she had probably made her escape. They sent messengers in various directions to pursue, and restore her, but they never heard of her more! Perhaps they would not have been so unfortunate in their search, if they had dug near the garden wall! Finally, the nuns concluded that she must have gone to a great distance, and because one of them happened to say, she has taken refuge in Holland, “O yes,” said they, “she has, without doubt, taken refuge in Holland.” The signora did not believe this, but she had certain reasons for encouraging the opinion, and this she did not fail to do. Thus the minds of the nuns became satisfied; but who can tell the torments of the signora's soul? Who can tell how many times a day the image of this sister came unbidden into her mind, and fastened itself there with terrible tenacity? Who can tell how many times she desired to behold the real and living person, for the company of this empty, impassible, terrible shade? Who can tell with what delight she would have heard the very words of the threat repeated in her mental ear, rather than this continual and fantastic murmur of those very words, sounding with a pertinacity of which no living voice could have been capable.

It was about a year after this event, that we find Lucy at the monastery, and under the protection of the signora. The reader may remember, that after Agnes and the portress had left the room, the signora and Lucy had entered into conversation alone; the former continued her questions concerning Don Roderick, with a fearlessness which filled the mind of Lucy with astonishment, little supposing that the curiosity of the nuns ever exercised itself upon such subjects. The opinions which were blended with these enquiries, were not less strange; she laughed at the dread which Lucy expressed herself to have of Don Roderick, asking her if he was not handsome; and surmising that Lucy would have liked him very well, if it had not been for her preference of Renzo. When again with her mother, the poor girl expressed her astonishment at such observations from such a source, but Agnes, as more experienced, solved the mystery. “Do not be surprised,” said she; “when you have known the world as I have, you will cease to wonder at any thing. The nobility, some more, some less, some one way, some another, have all a little oddity. We must let them talk, especially when we have need of them; we must appear to listen to them seriously, as if they were talking very wisely. Did you not hear how she interrupted me, as if I had uttered some absurdity? I did not wonder at it; they are all so. Notwithstanding that, Heaven be thanked, she seems to have taken a liking to you, and is willing to protect us; and if we would retain her favour, we must let her say that which it shall please her to say.”

A desire to oblige the superior, the complacency experienced in protecting, the thought of the good opinions which would be the result of a protection thus piously extended, a certain inclination towards Lucy, and also a degree of self-satisfaction in doing good to an innocent creature, in succouring and consoling the oppressed, had really disposed the signora to take to heart the fate of our poor fugitives. The mother and daughter congratulated themselves on their safe and honourable asylum. They would have wished to remain unknown to all; but this, in a convent, was impossible; and one there was, besides, too far interested in obtaining an account of one of the two, stimulated as his passion had been by the opposition he had encountered. We will leave them for the present in their safe retreat, and return to the palace of Don Roderick, at the hour in which he was anxiously expecting the result of his wicked and villanous enterprise.
CHAPTER XI.

As a pack of blood-hounds, after having in vain tracked the hare, return desponding towards their master, with their ears down, and tails hanging, so, in this night of confusion, returned the bravoes to the palace of Don Roderick, who was pacing, in the dark, the floor of an upper uninhabited chamber. Full of impatience and uncertainty as to the issue of the expedition, and not without anxiety for the possible consequences, his ear was attentive to every sound, and his eye to every movement on the esplanade. This was the most daring piece of villany he had ever undertaken; but he felt that the precautions he had used would preserve him from suspicion. “And who will dare to come here, and ask if she is not in this palace? Should this young fellow do so, he will be well received, I promise him. Let the friar come! yea, let him come. If the old woman presumes so far, she shall be sent to Bergamo. As for the law, I do fear it not; the podestà is neither a boy nor a fool! Pshaw! there's nothing to fear. How will Attilio be surprised to-morrow morning; he will find I am not a mere boaster. But if any difficulty should arise, he'll assist—the honour of all my relatives will be pledged.” But these anxious thoughts subsided as he reverted to Lucy.—“She will be frightened to find herself alone, surrounded only by these rough visages: by Bacchus, the most human face here is my own, and she will be obliged to have recourse to me—to entreaty.” In the midst of these calculations he heard a trampling of feet, approached the window, and looking out exclaimed, “It is they! But the litter! the devil! where is the litter? Three, five, eight, they are all there; but where is the litter? The devil! Griso shall render me an account of this.” He then advanced to the head of the stairs to meet Griso. “Well,” cried he, “Signor Bully, Signor Captain, Signor ‘Leave it to me!’”

“It is hard,” said Griso,—“it is hard to meet with reproach, when one has hazarded one's life to perform his duty.”

“How has it happened? Let us hear, let us hear,” said he, as he advanced towards the room, followed by Griso, who related, as clearly as he could, the occurrences of the night.

“Thou hast done well,” said Don Roderick; “thou hast done all that thou couldst—but to think that this roof harbours a spy! If I discover him I will settle matters for him; and I tell thee, Griso, I suspect the information was given the day of the dinner.”

“I have had the same suspicion,” said Griso; “and if my master discovers the scoundrel, he has only to trust him to me. He has made me pass a troublesome night, and I wish to pay him for it. But there must be, I think, some other cause, which we cannot at present fathom; to-morrow, Signor, to-morrow we will see clear water.”

“Have you been recognised by any one?”

Griso thought not; and after having given him many orders for the morrow, and wishing to make amends for the impetuosity with which he had at first greeted him, Don Roderick said, “Go to rest, poor Griso! you must indeed require it. Labouring all day, and half the night, and then to be received in this manner! Go to rest now; for we may yet be obliged to put your friendship to a severer test. Good night.”

The next morning Don Roderick sought the Count Attilio, who, receiving him with a laugh, said, “San Martin!”

“I will pay the wager,” said Don Roderick. “I thought indeed to have surprised you this morning, and therefore have kept from you some circumstances. I will now tell you all.”

“The friar's hand is in this business,” said his cousin, after having heard him through: “this friar, with his playing at bo-peep, and giving advice; I know him for a busybody and a rascal! And you did not confide in me, and tell me what brought him here the other day to trifle with you. If I had been in your place he should not have gone out as he came in, of that be assured.”

“What! would you wish me to incur the resentment of all the capuchins in Italy?”

“In such a moment,” said the count, “I should have forgotten there was any other capuchin in the world than this daring rascal; but the means are not wanting, within the pale of prudence, to take satisfaction even of a capuchin. It is well for him that he has escaped the punishment best suited to him; but I take him henceforth under my protection, and will teach him how to speak to his superiors.”

“Do not make matters worse.”

“Trust me for once; I will serve you as a relation and a friend.”

“What do you mean to do?”

“I don't know yet; but I will certainly pay the friar. Let me see—the count my uncle, who is one of the secret council, will do the service; dear uncle! How pleased I am when I can make him work for me, a politician of his stamp! The day after to-morrow I will be at Milan, and in some way or other the friar shall have his due.”

Meanwhile breakfast was brought in, which however did not interrupt the important discussion. Count Attilio interested himself in the cause from his friendship for his cousin, and the honour of the name, according to his notions of friendship and honour; yet he could hardly help laughing every now and then at the ridiculous issue of the adventure. But Don Roderick, who had calculated upon making a master-stroke, was vexed at his signal failure, and agitated by various passions. “Fine stories will be circulated,” said he, “of last night's affair, but no matter; as to justice, I defy it: it does not exist; and if it did, I should equally defy it. Apropos, I have sent word this morning to the constable, to make no deposition respecting the affair, and he will be sure to follow my advice; but tattling always annoys me,—it is enough that you have it in your power to laugh at me.”

“It is well you have given the constable his message,” said the count; “this great empty-headed, obstinate proser of a podestà is however a man who knows his duty, and we must be careful not to place him in difficulty. If a fellow of a constable makes a deposition, the podestà, however well intentioned, is obliged to——”

“But you,” interrupted Don Roderick, with a little warmth,—“you spoil my affairs, by contradicting him, and laughing at him on every occasion. Why the devil can't you suffer a magistrate to be an obstinate beast, while in other things that suit our convenience he is an honest man?”

“Do you know, cousin,” said the count, regarding him with an expression of affected surprise, “do you know that I begin to think you capable of fear? You take the podestà and myself to be in earnest.”

“Well, well, have not you yourself said that we should be careful?”

“Certainly; and when the question is serious, I will show you I am not a boy. Shall I tell you what I will do for you? I will go in person to make the podestà a visit; do you not think he will be pleased with the honour? And I will let him talk by the half hour of the count duke, and the Spanish keeper of the castle, and then I will throw in some remarks about the signor count of the secret council, my uncle; you know what effect this will have. Finally, he has more need of our protection, than you have of his condescension. He knows this well enough, and I shall leave him better disposed than I find him, that you may depend upon.” So saying, he took his departure, leaving Don Roderick alone to wait the return of Griso, who had been, in obedience to his orders, reconnoitring the ground, and ascertaining the state of the public mind with regard to the events of the preceding night. He came at last, at the hour of dinner, to give in his relation. The tumult of this night had been so loud, and the disappearance of three persons from the village so mysterious, that strict and indefatigable search would naturally be made for them; and on the other hand, those who were possessed of partial information on the subject were too numerous to preserve an entire silence. Perpetua was assailed every where to tell what had caused her master such a fright, and she, perceiving how she had been deceived by Agnes, and feeling exasperated at her perfidy, had need of a little self-restraint; not that she complained of the deception practised on herself, of that she did not breathe a syllable; but the injury done to her poor master could not pass in silence, and that such an injury should have been attempted by such worthy people! Don Abbondio could command and entreat her to be silent, and she could reply that there was no necessity for inculcating a thing so obvious and proper, but certain it is that the secret remained in the heart of the poor woman as new wine in an old cask, which ferments and bubbles, and if it does not send the bung into the air, works out in foam between the staves, and drops here and there, so that one can drink it, and tell what sort of wine it is. Jervase, who could scarcely believe that for once he knew a little more than others, and who felt himself a man, since he had been an accomplice in a criminal affair, was dying to communicate it. And Tony, however alarmed at the thoughts of further enquiries and investigation, was bursting, in spite of all his prudence, till he had told the whole secret to his wife, who was not dumb. The one who spoke least was Menico, because his parents, alarmed at his coming into collision with Don Roderick, had kept him in the house for several days; they themselves, however, without wishing to appear to know more than others, insinuated that the fugitives had taken refuge at Pescarenico. This report, then, became current among the villagers. But no one could account for the attack of the bravoes: all agreed in suspecting Don Roderick; but the rest was total obscurity. The presence of the three bravoes at the inn was discussed, and the landlord was interrogated; but his memory was, on this point, as defective as ever. His inn, he concluded as usual, was just like a sea-port. Who was this pilgrim, seen by Stefano and Carlandrea, and whom the robbers wished to murder, and had carried off? For what purpose had he been at the cottage? Some said it was a good spirit, come to the assistance of the inmates; others, that it was the spirit of a wicked pilgrim, who came at night to join such companions, and perform such deeds, as he had been accustomed to while living; others, again, went so far as to conjecture that it was one of these very robbers, clothed like a pilgrim; so that Griso, with all his experience, would have been at a loss to discover who it was, if he had expected to acquire this information from others. But, as the reader knows, that which was perplexity to them, was perfect clearness to Griso. He was enabled, therefore, from these various sources, to obtain a sufficiently distinct account for the ear of Don Roderick. He related the attempt upon Don Abbondio, which accounted for the desertion of the cottage, without the necessity of imagining a spy in the palace: he told of their flight, which might be accounted for by the fear of the discovery of their trick upon Don Abbondio, or by the intelligence that their cottage had been broken into, and that they had probably gone together to Pescarenico. “Fled together!” cried Don Roderick, hoarse with rage: “together! and this rascal friar! this friar shall answer it! Griso, this night I must know where they are. I shall have no peace; ascertain if they are at Pescarenico; quick; fly; four crowns immediately, and my protection for ever! this rascal! this friar!”

Griso was once more in the field; and on the evening of this very day reported to his worthy master the desired intelligence, and by the following means. The good man by whom the little party had been conducted to Monza, returning with his carriage to Pescarenico at the hour of vespers, chanced to meet, before he reached his home, a particular friend, to whom he related, in great confidence, the good work he had accomplished; so that Griso could, two hours after, inform Don Roderick that Lucy and her mother had taken refuge in a convent of Monza, and that Renzo had proceeded on his way to Milan. Don Roderick felt his hopes revive at this separation; and having, during great part of the night, revolved in his mind the measures for effecting his wicked purpose, he aroused Griso early in the morning, and gave him the orders he had premeditated.

“Signor?” said Griso, hesitating.

“Well, have I have not spoken clearly?”

“If you would send some other——”

“How?”

“Most illustrious signor, I am ready to sacrifice my life for my master, and it is my duty to do so; but you, you would not desire me to place it in peril?”

“Well?”

“Your illustrious lordship knows well these few murders that are laid to my account, and——Here I am under the protection of your lordship, and in Milan the livery of your lordship is known, but in Monza I am known. And, your lordship knows, I do not say it boastingly, he who should deliver me up to justice would be well rewarded, a hundred good crowns, and permission to liberate two banditti.”

“What, the devil!” said Don Roderick, “you are like a vile cur, who has scarce courage to rush at the legs of such as pass by the door; and, not daring to leave the house, keeps himself within the protection of his master.”

“I think I have given proof, signor,” said Griso.

“Well?”

“Well,” resumed Griso, boldly, thus put on his mettle, “your lordship must forget my hesitation; heart of a lion, legs of a hare, I am ready to go.”

“But you shall not go alone; take with you two of the best; Cut-face and Aim-well, and go boldly, and show yourself to be still Griso. The devil! people will be well content to let such faces as yours pass without molestation! And as to the bailiffs of Monza, they must have become weary of life to place it in such danger, for the chance of a hundred crowns! But I do not believe that I am so far unknown there, that the stamp of my service should pass for nothing.”

Griso, having received ample and minute instructions, took his departure, accompanied by the two bravoes; cursing in his heart the whims of his master.

It now became the design of Don Roderick to contrive some way, by which Renzo, separated as he was from Lucy, should be prevented from attempting to return. He thought that the most certain means would be to have him sent out of the state, but this required the sanction of the law; he could, for example, give a colouring to the attempt at the curate's house, and represent it as a seditious act, and through Doctor Azzecca Garbugli give the podestà to understand that it was his duty to apprehend Renzo. But while he thought of the doctor as the man the most suitable for this service, Renzo himself put an end to much further deliberation on the subject by withdrawing himself.

Like the boy who drives his little Indian pigs to the fold, whose obstinacy impels them divers ways, and thus obliges him first to apply to one and then to another till he can succeed in penning them all, so are we obliged to play the same game with the personages of our story. Having secured Lucy, we ran to Don Roderick. Him we now quit to give an account of Renzo.

After the mournful parting which we have related, he set out, discouraged and disheartened, on his way to Milan. To bid farewell to his home and his country, and what was more, to Lucy! to find himself among strangers, not knowing where to rest his head, and all on account of this villain! When these thoughts presented themselves to the mind of Renzo, he was, for the moment, absorbed by rage and the desire of revenge; but when he recollected the prayer that he had uttered with the good friar in the convent of Pescarenico, his better feelings prevailed, and he was enabled to acquire some degree of resignation to the chastisements of which he stood so much in need. The road lay between two high banks; it was muddy, stony, and furrowed by deep wheel tracks, which, after a rain, became rivulets, overflowing the road, and rendering it nearly impassable. In such places small raised footpaths indicated that others had found a way by the fields. Renzo ascended one of these paths to the high ground, whence he beheld, as if rising from a desert, and not in the midst of a city, the noble structure of the cathedral, and he forgot all his misfortunes in contemplating, even at a distance, this eighth wonder of the world, of which he had heard so much from his infancy. But looking back, he saw in the horizon the notched ridge of mountains, and distinctly perceiving, among them, his own Resegone, he gazed at it mournfully a while, and then with a beating heart went on his way; steeples, towers, cupolas, and roofs soon appeared: he descended into the road, and when he perceived that he was very near the city, he accosted a traveller, with the civility which was natural to him, “Will you be so good, sir——”

“What do you want, my good young man?”

“Will you be so good as to direct me by the shortest way to the convent of the capuchins, where Father Bonaventura resides?”

He replied, very affably, “My good lad, there is more than one convent; you must tell me more clearly what and whom you seek.”

Renzo then took from his bosom the letter of Father Christopher, and presented it to the gentleman, who, after having read it, returned it, saying, “The eastern gate; you are fortunate, young man—the convent you seek is but a short distance from this. Take this path to the left; it is a by-way, and in a little while you will find yourself by the side of a long and low building; that is the lazaretto; keep along the ditch that encircles it, and you will soon be at the eastern gate. Enter, and a few steps further on you will see before you an open square with fine elm trees; the convent is there—you cannot mistake it. God be with you!” And accompanying his last words with a kind wave of his hand, he proceeded on his way. Renzo was astonished at the good manners of the citizens to countrymen, not knowing that it was an extraordinary day, a day in which cloaks humbled themselves to doublets. He followed the path which had been pointed out to him, and arrived at the eastern entrance, which consisted of two pilasters, with a roofing above to secure the gates, and on one side was a small house for the toll-gatherer. The openings of the rampart descended irregularly, and their surface was filled with rubbish. The street of the suburb which led from this gate was not unlike the one which now opens from the Tosa gate. A small ditch ran in the midst of it, until within a few steps of the gate, and divided it into two small crooked streets, covered with dust or mud, according to the season. At the place where was, and is still, the collection of houses called the Borghetto, the ditch empties itself into a common sewer, and thence into another ditch which runs along the walls. At this point was a column with a cross oh it, dedicated to San Dionigi; to the right and left were gardens enclosed by hedges, and at intervals, small houses inhabited for the most part by washerwomen. Renzo passed through the gate, without being stopped by the toll-gatherer, which appeared to him very remarkable, as he had heard those few of his townsmen, who could boast of having been at Milan, relate wonderful stories of the strict search and close enquiries to which those were subjected who entered its gates. The street was deserted, and if he had not heard the humming of a crowd at a distance, he might have thought he was entering a city which had been abandoned by its inhabitants. As he advanced, he saw on the pavement something scattered here and there, which was as white as snow, but snow at this season it could not be; he touched it, and found that it was flour. “There must be a great plenty in Milan,” said he, “if they thus throw away the gifts of God. They give out that famine is every where; this they do to keep poor people abroad quiet.” But in a few moments he arrived in front of the column, and saw on the steps of the pedestal certain things scattered, which were not assuredly stones, and which, if they had been on a baker's counter, he would not have hesitated to call loaves of bread. But Renzo dared not so easily trust his eyes, because truly this was not a place for bread. “Let us see what this is,” said he, and approaching the column, he took one in his hand; it was, indeed, a very white loaf of bread, such as Renzo was accustomed to eat only on festival days. “It is really bread!” said he, in wonder. “Do they scatter it thus here? And in a year like this? And do they suffer it to lie here, and not take the trouble to gather it? This must be a fine place to live in!” After ten miles of travel, in the fresh air of the morning, the sight of the bread awaked his appetite. “Shall I take it?” said he again. “Poh! they have left it to the dogs; surely, a Christian may take advantage of it; and if the owner should come, I can pay him at any rate.” So saying, he put in one pocket that which he had in his hand, took a second, and put it in the other, and a third, which he began to eat, and resumed his way, full of wonder at the strangeness of the incident. As he moved on he saw people approaching from the interior of the city; and his attention was drawn to those who appeared first; a man, a woman, and a boy, each with a load which seemed beyond their strength, and exhibiting each a grotesque appearance. Their clothes, or rather their rags, powdered with meal, their faces the same, and excessively heated; they walked, not only as if overcome by the weight, but as if their limbs had been beaten and bruised. The man supported with difficulty a great bag of flour, which having holes here and there, scattered its contents at every unequal movement. But the figure of the woman was still more remarkable: she had her petticoat turned up, filled with as much flour as it could hold, and a little more; so that from time to time it flew over the pavement. She was, indeed, a grotesque picture, with her arms stretched out to encompass her burden, and staggering under its weight, her bare legs were seen beneath it. The boy held with both hands a basket full of bread on his head, but he was detained behind his parents to pick up the loaves which were constantly falling from it.

“If you let another fall, you ugly little dog——” said the mother, in a rage.

“I don't let them fall; they fall of themselves. How can I help it?” replied he.

“Eh! it's well for thee that my hands are full,” resumed the woman.

“Come, come,” said the man, “now that we have a little plenty, let us enjoy it in peace.”

Meanwhile there had arrived a company of strangers, and one of them addressed the woman, “Where are we to go for bread?”—“On, on,” replied she, and added, muttering, “These rascal countrymen will sweep all the shops and warehouses, and leave none for us.”

“There is a share for every one, chatterer,” said her husband; “plenty, plenty.”

From all that Renzo saw and heard, he gathered that there was an insurrection in the city, and that each one provided for himself, in proportion to his will and strength. Although we would desire to make our poor mountaineer appear to the most advantage, historical truth obliges us to say that his first sentiment was that of complacency. He had so little to rejoice at, in the ordinary course of affairs, that he congratulated himself on a change, of whatever nature it might be. And for the rest, he, who was not a man superior to the age in which he lived, held the common opinion that the scarcity of bread had been caused by the speculators and bakers, and that any method would be justifiable, of wresting from them the aliment which they cruelly denied to the people. However, he determined to keep away from the tumult, and congratulated himself on the good fortune of having for his friend a capuchin, who would afford him shelter and good advice. Occupied with such reflections, and noticing from time to time as more people came up loaded with plunder, he proceeded to the convent.

The church and convent of the capuchins was situated in the centre of a small square, shaded by elm trees; Renzo placed in his bosom his remaining half loaf, and with his letter in his hand, approached the gate and rung the bell. At a small grated window appeared the face of a friar, porter to the convent, to ask “who was there?”

“One from the country, who brings a letter to Father Bonaventura, from Father Christopher.”

“Give here,” said the friar, thrusting his hand through the grate.

“No, no,” said Renzo, “I must give it into his own hands.”

“He is not in the convent.”

“Suffer me to enter and wait for him,” replied Renzo.

“You had best wait in the church,” said the friar; “perhaps that may be of service to you. Into the convent you do not enter at present.” So saying, he hastily closed the window, leaving Renzo to receive the repulse with the best grace he could. He was about to follow the advice of the porter, when he was seized with the desire to give a glance at the tumult. He crossed the square, and advanced towards the middle of the city, where the disturbance was greatest. Whilst he is proceeding thither, we will relate, as briefly as possible, the causes of this commotion.
CHAPTER XII.

This was the second year of the scarcity; in the preceding one, the provisions, remaining from past years, had supplied in some measure the deficiency, and we find the population neither altogether satisfied, nor yet starved; but certainly unprovided for in the year 1628, the period of our story. Now this harvest, so anxiously desired, was still more deficient than that of the past year, partly from the character of the season itself (and that not only in the Milanese but also in the surrounding country), and partly from the instrumentality of men. The havoc of the war, of which we have before made mention, had so devastated the state, that a greater number of farms than ordinary remained uncultivated and deserted by the peasants, who, instead of providing, by their labour, bread for their families, were obliged to beg it from door to door. We say a greater number of farms than ordinary, because the insupportable taxes, levied with a cupidity and folly unequalled; the habitual conduct, even in time of peace, of the standing troops (conduct which the mournful documents of the age compare to that of an invading army), and other causes which we cannot enumerate, had for some time slowly operated to produce these sad effects in all the Milanese,—the particular circumstances of which we now speak were, therefore, like the unexpected exasperation of a chronic disease. Hardly had this harvest been gathered, when the supplies for the army, and the waste which always accompanies them, caused an excessive scarcity, and with it its painful but profitable concomitant, a high price upon provisions; but this, attaining a certain point, always creates in the mind of the multitude a suspicion that scarcity is not in reality the cause of it. They forget that they had both feared and predicted it: they imagine all at once that there must be grain sufficient, and that the evil lies in an unwillingness to sell it for consumption. Preposterous as these suppositions were, they were governed by them, so that the speculators in grain, real or imaginary, the farmers, the bakers, became the object of their universal dislike. They could tell certainly where there were magazines overflowing with grain, and could even enumerate the number of sacks: they spoke with assurance of the immense quantity of corn which had been despatched to other places, where probably the people were deluded with a similar story, and made to believe that the grain raised among them had been sent to Milan! They implored from the magistrate those precautions, which always appear equitable and simple to the populace. The magistrates complied, and fixed the price on each commodity, threatening punishment to such as should refuse to sell; notwithstanding this, the evil continued to increase. This the people attributed to the feebleness of the remedies, and loudly called for some of a more decided character; unhappily they found a man that was willing to grant them all they should ask.

In the absence of the Governor Don Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, who was encamped beyond Casale, in Montferrat, the High Chancellor Antonio Ferrer, also a Spaniard, supplied his place in Milan. He considered the low price of bread to be in itself desirable, and vainly imagined that an order from him would be sufficient to accomplish it. He fixed the limit, therefore, at the price the bread would have had when corn was thirty-three livres the bushel; whereas it was now as high as eighty.

Over the execution of these laws the people themselves watched, and were determined to receive the benefit of them quickly. They assembled in crowds before the bakers' houses to demand bread at the price fixed; there was no remedy; the bakers were employed night and day in supplying their wants, inasmuch as the people, having a confused idea that the privilege would be transient, ceased not to besiege their houses, in order to enjoy to the utmost their temporary good fortune. The magistrates threatened punishment—the multitude murmured at every delay of the bakers in furnishing them. These remonstrated incessantly against the iniquitous and insupportable weight of the burden imposed on them; but Antonio Ferrer replied, that they had possessed great advantages in times past, and now owed the public some reparation. Finally, the council of ten (a municipal magistracy composed of nobles, which lasted until the ninety-seventh year of the century just elapsed,) informed the governor of the state in which things were, hoping that he would find some remedy. Don Gonzalo, immersed in the business of war, named a council, upon whom he conferred authority to fix a reasonable price upon bread, so that both parties should be satisfied. The deputies assembled, and after much deliberation felt themselves compelled to augment the price of it: the bakers breathed, but the people became furious.

The evening preceding the day on which Renzo arrived at Milan, the streets swarmed with people, who, governed by one common feeling, strangers or friends, had intuitively united themselves in companies throughout the city. Every observation tended to increase their rage and their resentment; various opinions were given, and many exclamations uttered; here, one declaimed aloud to a circle of bystanders, who applauded vehemently; there, another more cautious, but not less dangerous, was whispering in the ear of a neighbour or two, that something must and would be done: in short, there was an incessant and discordant din from the medley of men, women, and children, which composed the various assemblages. There was now only required an impetus to set the machine in motion, and reduce words to deeds; and an opportunity soon presented itself. At the break of day little boys were seen issuing from the bakers' shops with baskets on their heads, loaded with bread, which they were about to carry to their usual customers. The appearance of one of these unlucky boys in an assembly of people was like a squib thrown into a gunpowder mill. “Here is bread!” cried a hundred voices at once. “Yes, for our tyrants, who swim in abundance, and wish to make us die in hunger,” said one, who drew near the boy, and seizing the basket, cried out, “Let us see.” The boy coloured, grew pale, trembled, and would have entreated them to let him pass on, but the words died on his lips; he then endeavoured to free himself from the basket. “Down with the basket” was heard on all sides; it was seized by many hands, and placed on the earth: they raised the napkin which covered it, and a tepid fragrance diffused itself around. “We are Christians also,” said one; “and have a right to eat bread as well as other people:” so saying, he took a loaf and bit it; the rest followed his example; and it is unnecessary to add, that in a few moments the contents of the basket had disappeared. Those who had not been able to secure any for themselves were irritated at the sight of their neighbours' gains, and animated by the facility of the enterprise, went in search of other boys with baskets; as many, therefore, as they met were stopped and plundered. Still the number who remained unsatisfied was beyond comparison the greatest, and even the gainers were only stimulated by their success to ampler enterprises; so that simultaneously there was a shout from the crowd of “To the bake-house! to the bake-house!”

In the street called the Corsia de' Servi there was, and is still, a bakery of the same name,—a name that signifies in Tuscan the Shop of the Crutches, and in Milanese is composed of such barbarous words, that it is impossible to discover their sound from any rule of the language.[4] To this place the throng approached: the shopkeepers were listening to the sad relation of the boys, who had but just escaped with their lives, when they heard a distant murmur, and beheld the crowd advancing.

“Shut, shut! quick, quick!” some ran to ask aid from the sheriff; others in haste closed the shop, and barricadoed and secured the doors from within. The throng thickened in front, and cries of “Bread, bread! open, open!” were heard from every quarter. The sheriff arrived with a troop of halberdiers. “Make way, make way, friends! home, home! make way for the sheriff,” cried they. The people gave way a little, so that they could draw themselves up in front of the door of the shop. “But, friends,” cried the sheriff from this place, “what do you do here? Home, home! have you no fear of God? What will our lord the king say? We do not wish you harm; but go home. There is no good to be gained here for soul or body. Home, home!” The crowd, regardless of his expostulations, pressed forward, themselves being urged on by increasing multitudes behind. “Make them draw back, that I may recover breath,” continued he to the halberdiers, “but harm no one—we will endeavour to get into the shop—make them keep back, and knock at the door.”—“Back, back,” cried the halberdiers, presenting the but-ends of their arms; the throng retreated a little; the sheriff knocked, crying to those within to open; they obeyed, and he and his guard contrived to intrench themselves within the house; then, appearing at a window above, “Friends,” cried he, “go home. A general pardon to whoever shall return immediately to their houses.”

“Bread, bread! open, open!” vociferated the crowd in reply.

“You shall have justice, friends; but return to your houses. You shall have bread; but this is not the way to obtain it. Eh! what are you doing below there? At the door of the house! hah! hah! Take care; it is a criminal act. Eh! away with those tools! take down those hands! hah! hah! You Milanese, who are famous throughout the world for your benevolence, who have always been accounted good citi——  Ah! rascals!”

This rapid change of style was occasioned by a stone thrown by one of these good citizens at the sheriff's head. “Rascals! rascals!” continued he, closing the window in a rage. The confusion below increased; stones were thrown at the doors and windows, and they had nearly opened a way into the shop. Meanwhile the master and boys of the shop, who were at the windows of the story above, with a supply of stones (obtained probably from the court-yard), threatened to throw them upon the crowd if they did not disperse. Perceiving their threats to be of no avail, they commenced putting them in execution.

“Ah! villains! ah! rogues! Is this the bread you give to the poor?” was screamed from below. Many were wounded, two were killed; the fury of the multitude increased; the doors were broken open, and the torrent rushed through all the passages. At this, those within took refuge under the shop floor; the sheriff and the halberdiers hid themselves beneath the tiles; others escaped by the skylights, and wandered upon the roofs like cats.

The sight of their prey made the conquerors forget their designs of sanguinary vengeance; some rushed to the chests, and plundered them of bread; others hastened to force the locks of the counter, and took from thence handfulls of money, which they pocketed, and then returned to take more bread, if there should remain any. Others, again, entered the interior magazines, and, throwing out part of the flour, reduced the bags to a portable size; some attacked a kneading trough, and made a booty of the dough; a few had made a prize of a bolting cloth, which they raised in the air as in triumph, and, in addition to all, men, women, and children were covered with a cloud of white powder.

While this shop was so ransacked, none of the others in the city remained quiet, or free from danger. But at none had the people assembled in such numbers as to be very daring; in some, the owners had provided auxiliaries, and were on the defensive; in others, the owners less strong in numbers, and more affrighted, endeavoured to compromise matters; they distributed bread to those who crowded around their shops, and thus got rid of them. And these did not depart so much because they were content with the acquisition, as from fear of the halberdiers and officers of justice, who were now scattered throughout the city, in companies sufficient to keep these little bands of mutineers in subjection. In the mean time the tumult and the crowd increased in front of the unfortunate bakery, as the strength of the populace had here the advantage. Things were in this situation, when Renzo, coming from the eastern gate, approached, without knowing it, the scene of tumult. Hurried along by the crowd, he endeavoured to extract from the confused shouting of the throng some more positive information of the real state of affairs.

“Now the infamous imposition of these rascals is discovered,” said one; “they said there was neither bread, flour, nor corn. Now we know things just as they are, and they can no longer deceive us.”

“I tell you that all this answers no purpose,” said another; “it will do no good unless justice be done to us. Bread will be cheap enough, 'tis true, but they will put poison in it to make the poor die like flies. They have already said we are too numerous, I know they have; I heard it from one of my acquaintances, who is a friend of a relation of a scullion of one of the lords.”

“Make way, make way, gentlemen, I beseech you; make way for a poor father of a family who is carrying bread to five children!” This was said by one who came staggering under the weight of a bag of flour.

“I,” said another, in an under tone, to one of his companions, “I am going away. I am a man of the world, and I know how these things go. These clowns, who now make so much noise, will prove themselves cowards to-morrow. I have already perceived some among the crowd who are taking note of those who are present, and when all is over, they will make up the account, and the guilty will pay the penalty.”

“He who protects the bakers,” cried a sonorous voice, which attracted the attention of Renzo, “is the superintendent of provisions.”

“They are all rogues,” said a neighbour.

“Yes, but he is the chief,” replied the one who had first spoken.

The superintendent of provisions, elected every year by the governor from a list of seven nobles formed from the council of ten, was the president of the court of provision, which, composed of twelve nobles, had, with other duties, that of superintending the corn for the citizens. Persons in such a station would naturally, in times of starvation and ignorance, be considered as the authors of all the evil.

“Cheats!” exclaimed another; “can they do worse? They have had the audacity to say that the high chancellor is a childish old man, and they wish to take the government into their own hands. We ought to make a great coop, and put them in, to feed upon dry peas and cockleweed, as they would fain have us do.”

While listening to such observations as the above, Renzo continued to make his way through the crowd, and at last arrived in front of the bakery. On viewing its dilapidated and ruinous state, after the assault just sustained, “This cannot be a good deed,” thought he: “if they treat all the bake-houses in this manner, where will they make bread?”

From time to time, some were seen issuing from the house, loaded with pieces of chests, or troughs, or a bench, basket, or some other relic of the poor building, and crying, “Make way, make way!” passed through the crowd. These were all carried in the same direction, and it appeared to a place agreed upon. Renzo's curiosity being excited, he followed one who carried a bundle of pieces of board and chips on his shoulder, and found that he took the direction of the cathedral. On passing it, the mountaineer could not avoid stopping a moment to gaze with admiring eyes on the magnificent structure. He then quickened his steps to rejoin him whom he had taken as a guide, and, keeping behind him, they drew near the middle of the square. The crowd was here more dense, but they opened a way for the carrier, and Renzo, skilfully introducing himself in the void left by him, arrived with him in the very midst of the multitude. Here there was an open space, in the centre of which was a bonfire, a heap of embers, the remains of the tools mentioned above; surrounding it was heard a clapping of hands and stamping of feet, the tumult of a thousand cries of triumph and imprecation.

He of the boards threw them on the embers, and some, with pieces of half-burnt shovel, stirred them until the flame ascended, upon which their shouts were renewed louder than before. The flame sank again, and the company, for want of more combustibles, began to be weary, when a report spread, that at the Cordusio (a square or cross-way not far from there) they were besieging a bakery: then was heard on all sides, “Let us go, let us go;” and the crowd moved on. Renzo was drawn along with the current, but in the mean while held counsel with himself, whether he had not best withdraw from the fray, and return to the convent in search of Father Bonaventura; but curiosity again prevailed, and he suffered himself to be carried forward, with the determination, however, of remaining a mere spectator of the scene.

The multitude passed through the short and narrow street of Pescheria, and thence by the crooked arch to the square de' Mercanti. Here there were very few, who, in passing before the niche that divides towards the centre the terrace of the edifice then called the College of Doctors, did not give a slight glance at the great statue contained in it of Philip II., who even from the marble imposed respect, and who, with his arm extended, appeared to be menacing the populace for their rebellion.

This niche is now empty, and from a singular circumstance. About one hundred and sixty years after the events we are now relating, the head of the statue was changed, the sceptre taken from its hand, and a dagger substituted in its place, and beneath it was written Marcus Brutus. Thus inserted it remained perhaps a couple of years, until one day, some persons, who had no sympathies with Marcus Brutus, but rather an aversion to him, threw a rope around the statue, pulled it down, and, reducing it to a shapeless mass, dragged it, with many insulting gestures, beyond the walls of the city. Who would have foretold this to Andrea Biffi when he sculptured it?

From the square de' Mercanti, the clamorous troop at length arrived at the Cordusio. Each one immediately looked towards the shop; but, instead of the crowd of friends which they expected to find engaged on its demolition, there were but a few, at a distance from the shop, which was shut, and defended from the windows by armed people. They fell back, and there was a murmur through the crowd of unwillingness to risk the hazard of proceeding, when a voice was heard to cry aloud, “Near by is the house of the superintendent of provision; let us do justice, and plunder it.” There was a universal acceptance of the proposal, and “To the superintendent's! to the superintendent's!” was the only sound that could be heard. The crowd moved with unanimous fury towards the street where the house, named in such an evil moment, was situated.
CHAPTER XIII.

The unfortunate superintendent was at this moment painfully digesting his miserable dinner, whilst awaiting anxiously the termination of this hurricane; he was, however, far from suspecting that its greatest fury was to be spent on himself. Some benevolent persons hastened forward to inform him of his urgent peril. The servants, drawn to the door by the uproar, beheld, in affright, the dense mass advancing. While they listened to the friendly notice, the vanguard appeared; one hastily informed his master; and while he, for a moment, deliberated upon flight, another came to say there was no longer time for it; in hurry and confusion they closed and barricadoed the windows and the doors. The howling without increased; each corner of the house resounded with it; and in the midst of the vast and mingled noise was heard, fearfully and distinctly, the blows of stones upon the door. “The tyrant! the tyrant! the causer of famine! we must have him, living or dead!”

The poor man wandered from room to room in a state of insupportable alarm, commending himself to God, and beseeching his servants to be firm, and to find for him some way of escape! He ascended to the highest floor, and, from an opening between the garret and the roof, he looked anxiously out upon the street, and beheld it filled with the enraged populace; more appalled than ever, he withdrew to seek the most secure and secret hiding-place. Here, concealed, he listened intently to ascertain if at any time the importunate transport of passion should weaken, if the tumult should in any degree subside; but his heart died within him to hear the uproar continue with aggravated and savage ferocity.

Renzo at this time found himself in the thickest of the confusion, not now carried there by the press, but by his own inclination. At the first proposal of blood-shedding, he felt his own curdle in his veins; as to the plundering, he was not quite certain whether it was right or wrong; but the idea of murder caused him unmixed horror. And although he was greatly persuaded that the vicar was the primary cause of the famine, the grand criminal, still, having, at the first movement of the crowd, heard, by chance, some expressions which indicated a willingness to make any effort to save him, he had suddenly determined to aid such a work, and had therefore pressed near the door, which was assailed in a thousand ways. Some were pounding the lock to break it in pieces; others assisted with stakes, and chisels, and hammers; others, again, tore away the plastering, and beat in pieces the wall, in order to effect a breach. The rest, who were unable to get near the house, encouraged by their shouts those who were at the work of destruction; though, fortunately, through the eagerness with which they pressed forward, they impeded its progress.

The magistrates, who were the first to have notice of the fray, despatched a messenger to ask military aid of the commander of the castle, which was then called, from the gate, Giovia; and he forthwith detached a troop, which arrived when the house was encompassed with the throng, and undergoing its tremendous assault; and was therefore obliged to halt at a distance from it, and at the extremity of the crowd. The officer who commanded it did not know what course to pursue; at the order to disperse and make way, the people replied by a deep and continued murmur, but no one moved. To fire on the crowd appeared not only savage, but perilous, inasmuch as the most harmless might be injured, and the most ferocious only irritated, and prepared for further mischief; and moreover his instructions did not authorise it. To break the crowd, and go forward with his band to the house, would have been the best, if success could have been certain; but who could tell if the soldiers could proceed united and in order? The irresolution of the commander seemed to proceed from fear: the populace were unmoved by the appearance of the soldiers, and continued their attacks on the house. At a little distance there stood an ill-looking, half-starved old man, who, contracting an angry countenance to a smile of diabolical complacency, brandished above his hoary head a hammer, with which he said he meant to nail the vicar to the posts of his door, alive as he was.

“Oh, shame! shame!” exclaimed Renzo. “Shame! would you take the hangman's business out of his hand? to assassinate a Christian? How can you expect God will give us bread, if we commit such iniquity? He will send us his thunders, and not bread!”

“Ah! dog! ah! traitor to the country!” cried one who had heard these words, turning to Renzo with the countenance of a demon. “It is a servant of the vicar's disguised like a countryman; it is a spy!” A hundred voices were heard exclaiming, “Who is it? where is he?”—“A servant of the vicar's—a spy—the vicar himself, escaping in the disguise of a peasant!”—“Where is he? where is he?”

Renzo would have shrunk into nothingness,—some of the more benevolent contrived to help him to disappear through the crowd; but that which preserved him most effectually was a cry of “Make way, here comes our help, make way!” which attracted the attention of the throng.

This was a long scaling ladder, supported by a few persons who were endeavouring to penetrate the living mass, and by which they meant to gain entrance to the house. But, happily, this was not easy of execution; the length of the machine precluded the possibility of its being carried easily through such a multitude; it came, however, just in time for Renzo, who profited by the confusion, and escaped to a distance, with the intention of making his way, as soon as he could, to the convent, in search of Father Bonaventura.

Suddenly a new movement began at one extremity, and diffused itself through the crowd:—“Ferrer, Ferrer!” resounded from every side. Some were surprised, some rejoiced, some were exasperated, some applauded, some affirmed, some denied, some blessed, some cursed!

“Is he here? It is not true; it is not true. Yes, yes, long live Ferrer, he who makes bread cheap.—No, no! He is here—here in a carriage! Why does he come?—we don't want him.—Ferrer! long live Ferrer! the friend of the poor! he comes to take the vicar prisoner.—No, no, we would revenge ourselves, we would fight our own battles; back, back.—Yes, yes, Ferrer! Let him come! to prison with the vicar!”

At the extremity of the crowd, on the side opposite to that where the soldiers were, Antonio Ferrer, the high chancellor, was approaching in his carriage, who, probably condemning himself as the cause of this commotion, had come to avert at least its most terrific and irreparable effects, to spend worthily a popularity unworthily acquired.

In popular tumults there are always some who, from heated passion, or fanaticism, or wicked design, do what they can to push things to the worst; proposing and promoting the most barbarous counsels, and assisting to stir the fire whenever it appears to slacken. But, on the other hand, there are always those who, perhaps with equal ardour, and equal perseverance, employ their efforts for the production of contrary effects; some led by friendship or partiality for the persons in danger, others without other impulse than that of horror of bloodshed and atrocity. The mass, then, is ever composed of a mixed assemblage, who, by indefinite gradations, hold to one or the other extreme; prompt to rage or compassion, to adoration or execration, according as the occasion presents itself for the developement of either of these sentiments: life and death are the words involuntarily uttered, and with equal facility; and he who succeeds in persuading them that such an one does not deserve to be quartered, has but little more to do, to convince them that he ought to be carried in triumph.

While these various interests were contending for superiority in the mob, before the house of the vicar, the appearance of Antonio Ferrer gave instantly a great advantage to the humane, who were manifestly yielding to the greater strength of the ferocious and blood-thirsty. The man himself was acceptable to the multitude, from his having previously favoured their cause, and from his heroic resistance to any arguments against it. Those already favourably inclined towards him were now much more affected by the courageous confidence of an old man, who, without guards or retinue, came thus to confront an angry and stormy multitude. The announcement that his purpose was to take the vicar prisoner, produced at once a wonderful effect; and the fury against that unhappy person, which would have been aggravated by any attempt at defiance, or refusal of concession, now, with the promise of satisfaction, and, to speak in the Milanese fashion, with this bone in the mouth, became in a degree appeased, and gave place to other opposite sentiments, which began to prevail over their minds.

The partisans of peace, having recovered breath, aided Ferrer in various ways; those who were near him, while endeavouring by their own to perpetuate the general applause, sought at the same time to keep off the crowd, so as to open a passage for the carriage; others applauded and repeated his words, or such as appeared appropriate to his undertaking and his peril; imposed silence on the obstinately furious, or contrived to turn against them the anger of the fickle assembly. “Who is it that will not say, Long live Ferrer? You don't wish bread to be cheap, then, eh? They are rogues who are not willing to receive justice at the hands of a Christian, and there are some among them who cry louder than the rest, to allow the vicar to escape. To prison with the superintendent! Long live Ferrer! Make way for Ferrer!” The numbers of those who spoke in this manner increasing continually, the numbers of the opposite party diminished in proportion; so that the former, from admonishing, had recourse to blows, in order to silence those who were still disposed to pursue the work of destruction. The menaces and threatenings of the weaker party were of no longer avail; the cause of blood had ceased to predominate, and in its place were heard only the cries of “Prison, justice, Ferrer!” The rebellious spirits were finally silenced: the remainder took possession of the door, in order to defend it from fresh attacks, and also to prepare a passage for Ferrer; and some among them called to those within (openings were not wanting) that succour had arrived, and that the vicar must get ready “to go quickly—to prison—hem! do you hear?”

“Is this the Ferrer who helps in making the proclamations?” asked our Renzo of one of his new neighbours, remembering the vidit Ferrera that the doctor had shown him appended to the famous proclamation, and which he had reiterated in his ears with so great a degree of pertinacity.

“The same, the high chancellor,” replied he.

“He is a worthy man, is he not?”

“He is more than worthy; it is he who has lowered the price of bread, against the wishes of others in power, and now he comes to carry the vicar to prison, because he has not acted justly.”

It is unnecessary to say, that Renzo's feelings were immediately enlisted on the side of Ferrer. He was desirous to approach near him, but the undertaking was no easy one; however, with the decision and strength of a mountaineer, he continued to elbow himself through the crowd, and finally reached the side of the carriage.

The carriage had already penetrated into the midst of the crowd, but was here suddenly stopped by one of those obstructions, the unavoidable consequence of a journey like this. The aged Ferrer presented, now at one window of his carriage, now at the other, a countenance full of humility, of sweetness, and benevolence; a countenance which he had always kept in reserve for the day in which he should appear before Don Philip IV.; but he was constrained to make use of it on this occasion. He spoke; but the noise and buzzing of so many voices, and the shouts of applause which they bestowed on him, allowed but little of his discourse to be heard. He had recourse also to gestures; now placing his fingers on his lips, to take from thence a kiss, which his enclosed hands distributed to right and left, as if to render thanks for the favour with which the public regarded him; then he extended them, waving them slowly beyond the window as if to entreat a little space; and now again lowering them politely, as if to request a little silence. When he had succeeded in obtaining, in some measure, his last request, those who were nearest to him heard and repeated his words:—“Bread, abundance. I come to do justice; a little space, if you please.” Then, as if stifled and suffocated with the press, and the continual buzzing of so many voices, he threw himself back in the carriage, and with difficulty drawing a long breath, said to himself, “Por mi vida, que de gente.”[5]

“Long live Ferrer; there is no occasion for fear; you are a brave man. Bread! bread!”

“Yes, bread, bread,” replied Ferrer, “in abundance! I promise you, I do,” placing his hand on his heart. “Clear a passage for me,” added he, then, in the loudest voice he could command; “I come to carry him to prison, to inflict on him a just punishment;” and he added, in a very low tone, “Si esta culpable.”[6] Then leaning forward to the coachman, he said hastily, “Adelante, Pedro, si puedes.”[7]

The coachman smiled also on the people with an affected politeness, as if he were some great personage; and, with ineffable grace, he waved the whip slowly from right to left, as if requesting his inconvenient neighbours to retire a little on either side. “Be so kind, gentlemen,” said he, “a little space, ever so little, just enough to let us pass.”

Meanwhile the most active and officious employed themselves in preparing the passage so politely requested. Some made the crowd retire from before the horses with good words, placing their hands on their breast, and pushing them gently, “There, there, a little space, gentlemen.” Others pursued the same plan at the sides of the carriage, so that it might pass on without damage to those who surrounded it; which would have subjected the popularity of Antonio Ferrer to great hazard. Renzo, after having been occupied for a few moments in admiring the respectable old man, a little disturbed by vexation, overwhelmed with fatigue, but animated by solicitude, embellished, so to speak, by the hope of wresting a fellow-creature from the pains of death,—Renzo, I say, threw away all idea of retreat. He resolved to assist Ferrer in every way that lay in his power, and not to abandon him until he had accomplished his designs. He united with the others to free the way, and he was certainly not one of the least active or industrious. A passage was opened. “Come on, come on,” said a number of them to the coachman, retiring in front of the crowd to maintain the passage clear. “Adelante, presto, con juicio[8],” said his master also to him, and the carriage moved forward. In the midst of the salutes which he lavished promiscuously on the public, Ferrer, with a smile of intelligence, bestowed particular thanks upon those whom he beheld busily employed for him; more than one of these smiles was directed to Renzo, who, in truth, deserved them richly, serving the high chancellor on this day with more devoted zeal than the most intrepid of his secretaries. The young mountaineer was delighted with his condescension, and proud of the honour of having, as he thought, formed a friendship with Antonio Ferrer.

The carriage, once in motion, continued its way with more or less slowness, and not without being frequently brought to a full stop. The space to be traversed was short, but, with respect to the time it occupied, it would have appeared interminable, even to one not governed by the holy motive of Ferrer. The people thronged around the carriage, to right and left, as dolphins around a vessel, hurried forward by a tempest. The noise was more piercing and discordant than that of a tempest itself. Ferrer continued to speak to the populace the whole length of the way. “Yes, gentlemen, bread in abundance. I will conduct him to prison; he shall be punished—si esta culpable.[9] Yes, yes, I will order it so; bread shall be cheap. Asi es. So it shall, I mean. The king our master does not wish his faithful subjects to suffer from hunger. Oh, oh! guardaos.[10] Take care that we do not hurt you, gentlemen, Pedro, adelante, con juicio.[11] Abundance! abundance! a little space, for the love of Heaven! Bread, bread! To prison! to prison! What do you want?” demanded he of a man who had thrust himself partly within the window to howl at him some advice, or petition, or applause, no matter what; but he, without having heard the question, had been drawn back by another, who saw him in danger of being crushed by the wheel. Amidst all this clamour, Ferrer at last gained the house, thanks to his kind auxiliaries.

Those who had stationed themselves there had equally laboured to procure the desired result, and had succeeded in dividing the crowd in two, and keeping them back, so that between the door and the carriage there should be an empty space, however small. Renzo, who in acting as a scout and a guide had arrived with the carriage, was able to find a place, whence he could, by making a rampart of his powerful shoulders, see distinctly all that passed.

Ferrer breathed again on seeing the place free, and the door still shut, or, to speak more correctly, not yet open. However, the hinges were nearly torn from their fastenings, and the panels shivered in many pieces; so that an opening was made, through which it could be seen that what held it together was the bolt, which, however, was almost twisted from its socket. Through this breach some one cried to those within to open the door, another ran to let down the steps of the carriage, and the old man descended from it, leaning on the arm of this benevolent person.

The crowd pressed forward to behold him: curiosity and general attention caused a moment's silence. Ferrer stopped an instant on the steps, turned towards them, and putting his hand to his heart, said, “Bread and justice.” Clothed in his toga, with head erect, and step assured, he continued to descend, amid the loud applause that rent the skies.

In the mean while the people of the house had opened the door, so as to permit the entrance of so desired a guest; taking care, however, to contract the opening to the space his body would occupy. “Quick, quick!” said he, “open, so that I may enter; and you, brave men, keep back the people, do not let them come behind me—for the love of Heaven! Open a way for us, presently.—Eh! eh! gentlemen, one moment,” said he to the people of the house; “softly with this door; let me pass. Oh, my ribs, take care of my ribs. Shut now—no, my gown, my gown!” It would have remained caught within the door if Ferrer had not hastily withdrawn it.

The doors, closed in the best manner they could be, were nevertheless supported with bars from within. On the outside, those who had constituted themselves the bodyguard of Ferrer worked with their shoulders, their arms, and their voice to keep the place empty, praying from the bottom of their hearts that they would be expeditious.

“Quick, quick!” said Ferrer, as he reached the portico, to the servants who surrounded him, crying, “May your excellency be rewarded! What goodness! Great God, what goodness!”

“Quick, quick,” repeated Ferrer, “where is this poor man?”

The superintendent descended the stairs half led, half carried by his domestics, and pale as death. When he saw who had come to his assistance, he sighed deeply, his pulse returned, and a slight colour tinged his cheek. He hastened to meet Ferrer, saying, “I am in the hands of God and your excellency; but how go hence? we are surrounded on all sides by people who desire my death.”

“Venga con migo usted[12], and take courage. My carriage is at the door; quick, quick!” He took him by the hand, and, continuing to encourage him, led him towards the door, saying in his heart, however, Aqui esta el busilis! Dios nos valga![13]

The door, opened; Ferrer appeared first; the superintendent followed, shrinking with fear, and clinging to the protecting toga, as an infant to the gown of its mother. Those who had maintained the space free raised their hands and waved their hats; making in this manner a sort of cloud to conceal the superintendent from the view of the people, and to enable him to enter the carriage, and place himself out of sight. Ferrer followed, and the carriage was closed. The people drew their own conclusions as to what had taken place, and there arose, in consequence, a mingled sound of applauses and imprecations.

The return of the carriage might seem to be even more difficult and dangerous; but the willingness of the public to suffer the superintendent to be carried to prison was sufficiently manifest; and the friends of Ferrer had been busy in keeping the way open whilst he was at the house, so that he could return with a little more speed than he went. As it advanced, the crowd, ranged on either side, closed and united their ranks behind it.

Ferrer, as soon as he was seated, whispered the superintendent to keep himself concealed in the bottom of the carriage, and not to let himself be seen, for the love of Heaven; there was, however, no need of this advice. It was the policy of the high chancellor, on the contrary, to attract as much of the attention of the populace as possible, and during all this passage, as in the former, he harangued his changeable auditory with a great quantity of sound, and very little sense; interrupting himself continually to breathe into the ear of his invisible companion a few hurried words of Spanish. “Yes, gentlemen, bread and justice. To the castle, to prison under my care. Thanks, thanks, a thousand thanks! No, no, he shall not escape! Por ablanderlos.[14] It is too just, we will examine, we will see. I wish you well. A severe punishment. Esto lo digo por su bien.[15] A just and moderate price, and punishment to those who oppose it. Keep off a little, I pray you. Yes, yes; I am the friend of the people. He shall be punished; it is true; he is a villain, a rascal. Perdone usted.[16] He shall be punished, he shall be punished—si esta culpable.[17] Yes, yes; we will make the bakers do that which is just. Long live the king! long live the good Milanese, his faithful subjects! Animo estamos ya quasi afuera.”[18]

They had, in fact, passed through the thickest of the throng, and were rapidly advancing to a place of safety; and now Ferrer gave his lungs a little repose, and looking forward, beheld the succours from Pisa, those Spanish soldiers, who had at last rendered themselves of service, by persuading some of the people to retire to their homes, and by keeping the passage free for the final escape. Upon the arrival of the carriage, they made room, and presented arms to the high chancellor, who bowed to right and left; and to the officer who approached the nearest to salute him he said, accompanying his words with a wave of his hand, “Beso à usted las manos[19],” which the officer interpreted to signify, You have given me much assistance!

He might have appropriately added, Cedant arma togæ; but the imagination of Ferrer was not at this moment at liberty to occupy itself with quotations, and, moreover, they would have been addressed to the wind, as the officer did not understand Latin.

Pedro felt his accustomed courage revive at the sight of these files of muskets, so respectfully raised; and recovering entirely from his amazement, he urged on his horses, without deigning to take further notice of the few, who were now harmless from their numbers.

“Levantese, levantese, estamos afueras[20],” said Ferrer to the superintendent, who, re-assured by the cessation of the tumult, the rapid motion of the carriage, and these words of encouragement, drew himself from his corner, and overwhelmed his liberator with thanks. The latter, after having condoled with him on account of his peril, and rejoiced at his deliverance, exclaimed, “Ah! que dira de esto su excelencia[21], who is already weary of this cursed Casale, because it will not surrender? que dira el conde duque?[22] who trembles if a leaf makes more noise than usual? Que dira el rey nuestro señor?[23] who must necessarily be informed of so great a tumult? And is it at an end? Dios lo sabe.”[24]—“Ah, as for me, I will have nothing more to do with it,” said the superintendent. “I wash my hands of it. I resign my office into the hands of your excellency, and I will go and live in a cavern on a mountain, as a hermit, far, very far from this savage people.”

“Usted[25] will do that which is best por el servicio de su majestad,” replied the high chancellor, gravely.

“His majesty does not desire my death,” replied the superintendent. “Yes, yes, in a cavern, in a cavern far from these cruel people.”

It is not known what became of this project, as, after conducting the poor man in safety to his castle, our author makes no farther mention of him.
CHAPTER XIV.

The crowd began to disperse; some went home to take care of their families, some wandered off from the desire to breathe more freely, after such a squeeze, and others sought their acquaintances, to chat with them over the deeds of the day. The other end of the street was also thinning, so that the detachment of Spanish soldiers could without resistance advance near the superintendent's house. In front of it there still remained, so to speak, the dregs of the commotion; a company of the seditious, who, discontented with “so lame and impotent a conclusion,” of that which promised so much, muttered curses at the disappointment, and united themselves in knots to consult with each other on the possibility of yet attempting something; and, to afford themselves proof that this was in their power, they attacked and pounded the poor door, which had been propped up anew from within. At the arrival of the troop, however, their valour diminished, and without further consultation they dispersed, leaving the place free to the soldiers, who took possession, in order to serve as a guard to the house and road. But the streets and small squares of the vicinity were full of little gatherings; where three or four individuals stopped, twenty were soon added to them; there was a confused and constant babbling; one narrated with emphasis the peculiar incidents of which he had been the witness, another related his own feats, another rejoiced that the affair had ended so happily, loaded Ferrer with praises, and predicted serious consequences to the superintendent; to which another still replied, that there was no danger of it, because wolves do not eat wolves; others, in anger, muttered that they had been duped, and that they were fools to allow themselves to be deceived in this manner.

Meanwhile the sun had set, and twilight threw the same indistinct hue over every object. Many, fatigued with the day, and wearied with conversing in the dark, returned to their houses. Our hero, after having assisted the carriage as far as was necessary, rejoiced when he beheld it in safety, and as soon as it was in his power left the crowd, so that he might, once more, breathe freely. Hardly had he taken a few steps in the open air, when he experienced a re-action after such excitement, and began to feel the need of food and repose; he therefore looked upward on either side, in search of a sign, which might hold out to him the prospect of satisfying his wants, as it was too late to think of going to the convent. Thus, walking with his eyes directed upward, he stumbled on one of these groups, and his attention was attracted by hearing them speak of designs and projects for the morrow; it appeared to him that he, who had been such a labourer in the field, had a right to give his opinion. Persuaded from all he had witnessed during the day, that, in order to secure the success of an enterprise, it was only necessary to gain the co-operation of the populace, “Gentlemen,” cried he, in a tone of exordium, “allow me to offer my humble opinion. My humble opinion is this; it is not only in the matter of bread that iniquity is practised: and since we have discovered to-day, that we have only to make ourselves heard, to obtain justice, we must go on, until we obtain redress for all their other knavish tricks—until we compel them to act like Christians. Is it not true, gentlemen, that there is a band of tyrants who reverse the tenth commandment; who commit injuries on the peaceful and the poor, and in the end make it out that they act justly? And even when they have committed a greater villany than usual, they carry their heads higher then ever. There are some such even in Milan.”

“Too many,” said a voice.

“I say it, I do,” resumed Renzo; “it has even reached our ears. And then the thing speaks for itself. By way of illustration, let us suppose one of those to whom I allude to have one foot in Milan, and the other elsewhere; if he is a devil there, will he be an angel here? Tell me, gentlemen, have you ever seen one of these people with a countenance like Ferrer's? But what renders their practices more wicked, I assure you that there are printed proclamations against them, in which their evil deeds are clearly pointed out, and a punishment assigned to each, and it is written, ‘Whoever he be, ignoble and plebeian, &c. &c.’ But go now to the doctors, scribes, and pharisees, and demand justice according to the proclamation; they listen to you as the pope does to rogues: it is enough to make an honest man turn rascal! It is evident, that the king and those who govern would willingly punish the villains, but they can do nothing, because there is a league among them. We must break it up, then; we must go to-morrow to Ferrer, who is a good worthy man; it was plain how delighted he was to-day to find himself among the poor; how he tried to hear what was said to him, and how kindly he answered them. We must go, then, to Ferrer, and inform him how things are situated; and I, for my part, can tell him something that will astonish him; I, who have seen with my own eyes a proclamation, with ever so many coats of arms at the head of it, and which had been made by three of the rulers; their names were printed at the bottom, and one of these names was Ferrer; this I saw with my own eyes! Now this proclamation was exactly suited to my case; so that I demanded justice from the doctor, since it was the desire of these three lords, among whom was Ferrer; but in the eyes of this very doctor, who had himself shown me this fine proclamation, I appeared to be a madman. I am sure that when this dear old man shall hear these doings, especially in the country, he will not let the world go on in this manner, but will quickly find some remedy. And then, they themselves, if they issue proclamations, they should wish to see them obeyed; for it is an insult, an epitaph, with their name, if counted for nothing. And if the nobility will not lower their pretensions, and cease their evil doings, we must compel them as we have done to-day. I do not say that he should go in his carriage to take all the rascals to gaol—it would need Noah's ark for that; he must give orders to those whose business it is, not only at Milan but elsewhere, to put the proclamations in force, to enter an action against such as have been guilty of those iniquities, and where the edict says, ‘Prison,’ then prison; where it says, ‘The galleys,’ the galleys; and to say to the various podestà that they must conduct themselves uprightly, or they shall be dismissed and others put in their place, and then, as I say, we will be there also to lend a helping hand, and to command the doctors to listen to the poor, and talk reasonably. Am I not right, gentlemen?”

Renzo had spoken so vehemently, that he had attracted the attention of the assembly, and, dropping by degrees all other discourse, they had all become his listeners. A confused clamour of applause, a “bravo! certainly! assuredly! he is right, it is but too true,” followed his harangue. Critics, however, were not wanting. “It is a pretty thing, indeed,” said one, “to listen to a mountaineer! they are all lawyers!” and he turned on his heel.

“Now,” muttered another, “every barefooted fellow will give his opinion, and with this rage for meddling, we shall at last not have bread at a low price, and that is all that disturbs us.” Compliments, however, were all that reached the ears of Renzo; they seized his hands, and exclaimed,—

“We will see you again to-morrow.”

“Where?”

“On the square of the cathedral.”

“Yes, very well. And something shall be done, something shall be done.”

“Which of these good gentlemen will show me an inn, where I may obtain refreshment and repose for the night?” said Renzo.

“I am the one for your service, worthy youth,” said one, who had listened to the sermon very attentively, but had not yet opened his mouth; “I know an inn, that will suit you exactly; I will recommend you to the keeper, who is my friend, and moreover a very honest man.”

“Near by?”

“Not very far off.”

The assembly dissolved; and Renzo, after many shakes of the hand, from persons unknown, followed his guide, adding many thanks for his courtesy.

“It is nothing, it is nothing,” said he; “one hand washes the other, and both the face. We ought to oblige our neighbour.” As they walked along, he put many questions to Renzo, by way of discourse.

“It is not from curiosity, nor to meddle with your affairs, but you appear to be fatigued. From what country do you come?”

“All the way from Lecco, all the way from Lecco.”

“All the way from Lecco! Are you from Lecco?”

“From Lecco; that is to say, from the province.”

“Poor youth! From what I have understood of your discourse, it appears you have been hardly treated.”

“Ah! my dear and worthy man, I have been obliged to use much skill in speaking, not to make the public acquainted with my affairs; but—it is enough that they will one day be known, and then——  But I see here a sign, and, by my faith, I don't wish to go farther.”

“No, no; come to the place I told you of, it is but a short distance off. You will not be well accommodated here.”

“Oh yes. I am not a gentleman accustomed to delicacies; any thing to satisfy my hunger; and a little straw will answer my purpose: that which I have most at heart is to find them both very soon, under Providence!” And he entered a large gate, from which hung a sign of the Full Moon.

“Well, I will conduct you here, since you desire it,” said the unknown; and Renzo followed him.

“There is no necessity for troubling you longer,” replied Renzo; “but,” he added, “do me the favour to go in, and take a glass with me.”

“I accept your obliging offer,” said he; and preceding Renzo as being more accustomed to the house, he entered a little court-yard, approached a glass door, and opening it, advanced into the kitchen with his companion.

It was lighted by two lamps suspended from the beam of the ceiling. Many people, all busy, were seated on benches which surrounded a narrow table, occupying almost all one side of the apartment; at intervals napkins were spread, and dishes of meat; cards played, and dice thrown; and bottles and wine-glasses amid them all. Berlinghe, reali, and parpagliole[26], were also scattered in profusion over the table, which, could they have spoken, would probably have said, “We were this morning in a baker's counter, or in the pocket of some spectator of the tumult, who, occupied with public affairs, neglected the care of private affairs.” The confusion was great; a boy ran to and fro busily engaged in attending to the dinner and gaming tables; the host was seated on a low bench under the mantle-tree of the chimney, apparently occupied in tracing figures in the ashes with the tongs, but in reality deeply attentive to all that passed around him. He raised his head at the sound of the latch, and turned towards the new comers. When he saw the guide, “Curse the fellow,” said he to himself, “he must always be under my feet, when I wish him at the devil!” Casting a rapid glance towards Renzo, he continued, “I know you not; but if you come with such a hunter, you are either a dog or a hare. When you shall have spoken a few words, I shall know which of the two you are.”

Nothing of this mute soliloquy could be traced, however, in the countenance of the host, who was motionless as a statue: his eyes were small and without expression, his face fat and shining, and his short and thick beard of a reddish hue.

“What are your orders, gentlemen?” said he.

“First, a good flagon of wine,” said Renzo, “and then something to eat.” So saying, he threw himself on a bench at one end of the table, and uttered a loud and sonorous Ah! as if to say, “It is a good thing to sit down after having been so long on one's feet.” But recollecting the table at which he had been seated the evening before with Agnes and Lucy, he sighed deeply. The host brought the wine; his companion had seated himself opposite to him; Renzo filled a glass for him, saying, “To wet your lips,” and another for himself, which he swallowed at a draught.

“What can you give me to eat?” said he, addressing the host.

“A good piece of stewed meat,” replied he.

“Well, sir, a good piece of stewed meat.”

“You shall be served immediately,” said the host, and calling to the boy, “Serve this gentleman. But,” resumed he, turning again to Renzo, “I have no bread to-day.”

“As for bread,” said Renzo, in a loud voice, and laughing, “Providence has provided that.” And he drew forth the third and last loaf, picked up under the cross of St. Dionigi, and holding it up, cried, “Here is the bread of Providence!”

At this exclamation many of the company turned round, and seeing this trophy in the air, one of them cried, “Bread for ever at a low price!”

“At a low price!” said Renzo; “gratis et amore.”

“Better still, better still.”

“But,” added he, “I do not wish these gentlemen to think evil of me. I have not stolen it—I found it on the ground; and if I could find the owner, I am ready to pay him.”

“Bravo, bravo!” cried they, laughing louder still, not imagining that he was in earnest.

“They think that I jest, but it is really so,” said Renzo to his guide, and turning the bread in his hand; “see how they have formed it—you would call it a cake, but they were so packed one on the other. If there were any with the crust a little tender, one might know they were fresh.” Then devouring three or four mouthfulls of the bread, he washed them down with another glass of wine, adding, “The bread will not go down alone—my throat was never so dry—a glorious uproar we made!”

“Prepare a good bed for this young man,” said the guide; “he is going to pass the night here.”

“Do you wish to sleep here?” said the host to Renzo, approaching the table.

“Certainly; I shall be content with any bed, provided the sheets are white; for although poor, I am accustomed to cleanliness.”

“Oh, as to that——” said the host. So saying, he went to his counter, which was in a corner of the kitchen, and returned, bringing in his hand paper, pen, and ink.

“What does this mean?” swallowing a piece of the stew which had been placed before him, and smiling with an air of surprise; “is that the white sheet?”

The host, without replying, placed the paper on the table, and himself in an attitude to write, and with the pen in his hand, leaning towards Renzo, he said, “Do me the favour to tell me your name and country.”

“What!” said Renzo, “what has this to do with the bed?”

“I do my duty,” said the host, looking at the guide. “We are obliged to give an exact account of all who lodge at our house. Name and surname, and from what country they are; why they are here; if they have arms; and how long they expect to remain in the city. These are the very words of the proclamation.”

Before answering, Renzo emptied another glass; it was the third, but I fear for the future we shall not find it possible to count them. “Ah, ah!” exclaimed he, “you have the proclamation. Well, I pride myself on being a doctor of laws, and I know what importance is attached to proclamations.”

“I speak in earnest,” said the host, looking again at the mute companion of Renzo; and returning to his desk, he drew from it a large sheet of paper, which he unfolded before Renzo, as an exact copy of the proclamation.

“Ah! there it is!” cried he, quickly emptying the contents of the glass which he held in his hand. “Ah! there it is! the fine sheet! I rejoice to see it. I know these arms; I know what this pagan head means with a noose around its neck.” (The proclamations of that time were headed by the arms of the governor, and in those of Don Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova was seen a Moorish king, chained by the throat.) “This face means, Command who can, and obey who will. When the Signor Don——shall have been sent to the galleys—well, well, I know what I would say—I have seen another leaf just like this. When he shall have so taken measures that an honest young man can, without molestation, marry her to whom he is betrothed, and by whom he is beloved, then I will tell my name to this face, and will give him a kiss in the bargain. I may have very good reasons for not telling my name; it's a fine thing, truly! And if a robber, who might have under his command a band of villains, because if he were alone——” He hesitated a moment, finishing the phrase with a gesture, and then proceeded, “If a robber wished to know who I was, in order to do me some evil turn, I ask you if that face would move from the paper to help me. Am I obliged to tell my business? Truly, this is something new. Suppose, for instance, that I have come to Milan to confess—I would wish to do it to a capuchin father, and not to the landlord of an inn.”

The host kept silence, looking at the guide, who appeared not to notice any thing that passed. Renzo, it grieves us to say, swallowed another glass, and continued, “I will give you reasons enough to satisfy you, my dear host; if those proclamations which speak favourably of good Christians are worth nothing, those which speak unfavourably are worth less than nothing. Take away, then, all these encumbrances, and bring in exchange another flagon, because this one is broken.” So saying, he struck it lightly with his hand, adding, “Don't you hear how it is cracked?”

The discourse of Renzo had again attracted the general attention of the company, and when he concluded, there was a general murmur of applause.

“What must I do?” said the host, looking at the strange companion, who was, however, no stranger to him.

“Yes, yes,” cried many of the company, “this countryman is right; they are vexatious impositions. New laws to-day! new laws to-day!”

The stranger took advantage of the noise to say to the host, in a tone of reproach for his too abrupt demand, “Leave him to his own way a little; do not raise a disturbance.”

“I have done my duty,” said the host aloud, “and secured myself,” continued he, lowering his voice; “and that is all I care for.” He removed the pen, ink, and paper, and gave the empty flagon to the boy.

“Bring the same kind of wine,” said Renzo, “for it suits my taste exactly; and we will send it to sleep with the other, without asking its name, surname, nor what is its business, nor whether it is going to remain long in this city.”

“Of the same kind,” said the host to the boy, giving him the flagon, and returning to his seat by the chimney. “He is no other than a hare,” thought he, raking in the ashes. “And in what hands art thou fallen, poor silly youth! If you will drown, drown; but the host of the Full Moon will not go halves with thy folly.”

Renzo returned thanks to his guide, and to all those who had taken his side. “Worthy friends,” said he, “I know that honest people support each other.” Then striking the table, and placing himself in the attitude of an orator, “Is it not an unheard of thing,” cried he, “that those who govern must always introduce paper, pen, and ink? Always the pen in hand! Such a passion for the pen!”

“Eh! young and worthy stranger! would you know the reason?” said one of the gamesters, laughing.

“Let us hear it,” replied Renzo.

“The reason is, as these lords eat geese, they have so many quills, they know not what to do with them.”

“Oh, oh!” said Renzo, “you are a poet! You have poets here, then? I have also a vein for poetry, and I sometimes make verses—but it is when things go on well.”

To comprehend this witticism of poor Renzo, it is necessary to be informed, that in the eyes of the vulgar of Milan, and more particularly in its environs, the name of poet did not signify, as among cultivated people, a sublime genius, an inhabitant of Pindus, a pupil of the muses, but a whimsicality and eccentricity in discourse and conduct, which had more of singularity than sense; and an absurd wresting of words from their legitimate signification.

“But I will tell the true reason,” added Renzo, “it is because they themselves hold the pen, and, therefore, they do not record their own words; but let a poor man speak, they are very attentive, and in a moment, there it is, in black and white for some future occasion. They are cunning, also; and when they want to perplex a poor youth, who does not know how to read, but who has a little——I know well——” beating his forehead with his hand, and pointing to it with his finger, to make himself understood; “and when they perceive that he begins to comprehend the difficulty, they throw into the conversation some Latin, to make him lose the thread of their argument, to put him at his wits' end, to confuse his brains. This custom must be broken up: to-day, every thing has been done after the people's fashion, without paper, pen, and ink. To-morrow, if they know how to conduct themselves, we shall do still better, without hurting a hair of any one's head; all in the way of justice.”

In the mean while some of the company had engaged again in play, and some in eating; some went away, others came in their place. The unknown guide continued to remain; and without appearing to have any business to detain him, lingered to talk a little more with Renzo, and resumed the conversation about bread.

“If I had the control, I would order things better,” said he.

“What would you do?” said Renzo, endeavouring to exhibit every appearance of attention.

“What would I do? Every one should have bread—the poor as well as the rich.”

“Ah! that is right.”

“See how I would do. I would fix a reasonable rate within the ability of every one; then bread should be distributed according to the number of mouths, because there are gluttons who seize all they can get for themselves, and leave the poor still in want. We must then divide it. And how shall we do this? Why in this way. Give a ticket to every family in proportion to the mouths, to authorise them to get bread from the bakers. For example: they give me a ticket expressed in this manner; Ambrose Fusella, by trade a sword cutler, with a wife and four children, all old enough to eat bread (mind that); he must be furnished with so much bread at such a price. But the thing must be done in order, always with regard to the number of mouths. For instance, they should give you a ticket for—your name?”

“Lorenzo Tramaglino,” said the young man, who, enchanted with the project, did not reflect that it all depended on pen, ink, and paper; and that the first point towards its success was to collect the names of the persons to be served.

“Very well,” said the unknown; “but have you a wife and children?”

“I ought to have—children, no—not yet—but a wife—if people had acted as their duty required——”

“Ah, you are single! then have patience; they will only give you a smaller portion.”

“That is but just. But if soon, as I hope—by the help of God—enough; suppose I have a wife.”

“Then the ticket must be changed, and the portion increased, as I have said, according to the mouths,” replied the unknown, rising.

“That would be very good,” cried Renzo, thumping the table with his fist; “and why don't they make such a law?”

“How can I tell you? meanwhile I wish you a good night, as my wife and children must have been expecting me this long while.”

“Another drop, another drop,” filling his glass, and endeavouring to force him to sit down again; “another drop!”

But his friend contrived to disengage himself; and leaving Renzo, pouring forth a torrent of entreaties and reproaches, he departed. Renzo continued to talk until he was in the street, and then fell back on his seat. He looked at the glass which he had filled to the brim; and seeing the boy pass before the table, he beckoned to him, as if he had something particular to communicate. He pointed to the glass, and with a tone of solemnity said, “See there! I prepared it for that worthy man; you see it is full, as it should be for a friend; but he would not have it. Sometimes people have singular ideas; however, I have shown my good will; but now, since the thing is done, it must not be lost.” So saying, he emptied it at one draught.

“I understand,” said the boy, moving off.

“You understand too, do you? It is true, when the reasons are sufficient——”

Here we have need of all our love of truth to induce us to pursue faithfully our hero's history; at the same time this same impartiality leads us to inform the reader, that this was his first error of a similar character; and precisely because he was so unaccustomed to merry-making did this prove so fatal. The few glasses of wine which he swallowed so rapidly, contrary to his custom, partly to cool his throat, and partly from an exaltation of spirits, which deprived him of the power of reflection, went immediately to his head. Upon an habitual drinker it would have produced no visible effect; our author observes this, that “temperate and moderate habits have this advantage, that the more a man practises them, the more he finds a departure from them to be disagreeable and inconvenient; so that his fault itself serves as a lesson to him for the future.”

However this may be, when these first fumes had mounted to the brain of Renzo, wine and words continued to flow without rule or reason. He felt a great desire to speak, and for a while his words were arranged with some degree of order, but by little and little he found it difficult to form a connected sentence. The thoughts which presented themselves to his mind were cloudy and indistinct, and his expressions, in consequence, unconnected and obscure: to relieve his perplexity, by one of those false instincts which, under similar circumstances, lead men to the accomplishment of their own ruin, he had recourse to the flagon.

We will relate only a few of the words which he continued to ejaculate, during the remainder of this miserable evening. “Ah! host, host,” resumed he, following him with his eye around the table, or gazing at him where he was not, and taking no notice of the noise of the company, “host that thou art! I cannot swallow it—this request of name, surname, and business. To a peaceable youth like me! you have not behaved well! what satisfaction, what advantage, what pleasure—to put a poor youth on paper? Am I not right—speak, gentlemen? Hosts should stand by good fellows. Listen, listen, host, I wish to make a comparison for you—for the reason——They laugh, do they? I am a little gay, I know; but the reasons, I say, are just. Tell me, if you please, who is it that brings custom to your house? Poor young men, is it not? Do these lords, they of the proclamations, ever come here to wet their lips?”

“They are all water-drinkers,” said one who sat near Renzo.

“They wish to keep possession of their understandings, so as to tell lies skilfully,” added another.

“Ah!” cried Renzo, “that is the poet who spoke. Then hear my reasons. Answer me, host. Ferrer, who is the best of all of them, has he ever been here to drink the health of any one, and to spend so much as a farthing? And this dog of an assassin, this Don ——? I must be silent, because I am too much in the humour for babbling. Ferrer, and Father Crr——, I know, are two honest men. But there are few honest men. The old are worse than the young; and the young—are much worse than the old. I am glad there was no blood shed, these are things we must leave to the hangman. Bread! Oh yes, for that I have had many a thrust, but I have also given some. Make way! Abundance! vivat! And Ferrer too—some words in Latin,—Si es baraos trapolorum. Cursed fault! vivat! justice! bread! Ah, those are good words! We had need of them. When we heard that cursed ton, ton, ton, and then again, ton, ton, ton, the question was not of flight; but hold the signor curate to—I, I know what I am thinking of.”

At these words he hung down his head, and remained for a time as if absorbed by some new imagination; then, sighing deeply, he raised it again, and looked up with such a mournful and silly expression, as excited the amusement of all around. In short, he became the laughingstock of the whole company. Not that they were all perfectly sober, but, to say truth, they were so in comparison with poor Renzo. They provoked and angered him with silly questions, and with mock civilities; sometimes he pretended to be offended, then, without noticing them at all, spoke of other things; then replied, then interrogated, and always wide of the mark. By good fortune, in his folly, he seemed from instinct to avoid pronouncing the names of persons; so that the one most deeply graven in his memory was not uttered. We should have been sorry ourselves if this name, for which we feel so much love and respect, had passed from mouth to mouth, and been made a theme of jesting by these vulgar and degraded wretches.
CHAPTER XV.

The host, seeing that the game was about to be carried too far, approached Renzo, and entreating the others to be quiet, endeavoured to make him understand that he had best go to bed. But our mountaineer could think of nothing but name, surname, and proclamations; yet the words bed and sleep, repeated frequently in his ear, made at last some impression, and producing a sort of lucid interval, made him feel that he really had need of both. The little sense that remained to him enabled him to perceive that the greater part of the company had departed; and with his hands resting on the table before him, he endeavoured to stand on his feet; his efforts would have been, however, unavailing, without the assistance of the host, who led him from between the table and the bench, and taking a lantern in one hand, managed partly to lead and partly to drag him to the stairs, and thence up the narrow staircase to the room designed for him. At the sight of the bed, he endeavoured to look kindly upon the host; but his eyes at one time sparkled, at another disappeared, like two fireflies: he endeavoured to stand erect, and stretched out his hand to pat the shoulder of his host in testimony of his gratitude; but in this he failed: however he did succeed in saying, “Worthy host, I see now that you are an honest man; but I don't like your rage for name and surname. Happily I am also——”

The host, who did not expect to hear him utter one connected idea, and who knew from experience how prone men in his situation were to sudden changes of feeling, wishing to profit by this lucid interval, made another attempt. “My dear fellow,” said he, in a tone of persuasion, “I have not intended to vex you, nor to pry into your affairs. What would you have had me do? There is a law, and if we innkeepers do not obey it, we shall be the first to be punished; therefore it is better to conform. And after all, as regards yourself, what is it? A hard thing, indeed! just to say two words. It is not for them, but to do me a favour. Now, here, between ourselves, tell me your name, and then you shall go to bed in peace.”

“Ah, rascal! knave!” cried Renzo, “do you dare to bring up this cursed name and surname and business again?”

“Hush! you fool! and go to bed,” said the host.

But Renzo continued to bellow, “I understand it, you belong to the league. Wait, wait, till I settle matters for you;” and turning to the door, he bellowed down the stairs, “Friends! the host is of the——”

“I spoke in jest,” cried the host, pushing him towards the bed, “in jest; did you not perceive I spoke in jest?”

“Ah, in jest; now you talk reasonably. Since you said it in jest—they are just the thing to make a jest of——.” And he fell on the bed. “Undress yourself quickly,” said the host; and adding his assistance to his advice, the thought occurred to him, to ascertain if there were any money in Renzo's pockets, as on the morrow it would fall into hands from which an innkeeper would have but little chance of recovering it; he therefore hazarded another attempt, saying to Renzo, “You are an honest youth, are you not?”

“Yes, an honest youth,” replied Renzo, still endeavouring to rid himself of his clothes.

“Well, settle this little account with me now, because to-morrow I am obliged to leave home on business.”

“That's right,” said Renzo “I am honest. But the money—we must find the money——!”

“Here it is,” said the host; and calling up all his patience and skill, he succeeded in obtaining the reckoning.

“Lend me your hand to finish undressing, host,” said Renzo; “I begin to comprehend, do you see, that——I am very sleepy.”

The host rendered him the desired service, and covering him with the quilt, bade him “Good night.”

The words were scarcely uttered before poor Renzo snored. The host stopped to contemplate him a moment by the light of his lantern; “Mad blockhead!” said he to the poor sleeper, “thou hast accomplished thy own ruin! dunces, who want to travel over the world, without knowing where the sun rises, to entangle themselves with affairs they know nothing of, to their own injury and that of their neighbour!”

So saying, he left the apartment, having locked the door outside, and calling to his wife, told her to take his place in the kitchen, “Because,” said he, “I must go out for a while, thanks to a stranger who is here, unhappily for me;” he then briefly related the annoying circumstance, adding, “And now keep an eye on all, and above all be prudent. There is below a company of dissolute fellows, who, between drink and their natural disposition, are very very free of speech. Enough—if any of them should dare——”

“Oh! I am not a child! I know what I ought to do. It could never be said——”

“Well, well. Be careful to make them pay. If they talk of the superintendant of provision, the governor, Ferrer, and the council of ten, and the gentry, and Spain and France, and other follies, pretend not to hear them, because, if you contradict them, it may go ill with you now, and if you argue with them, it may go ill with you hereafter; and take care, when you hear any dangerous remarks, turn away your head, and call out ‘Coming, sir.’ I will endeavour to return as soon as possible.”

So saying, he descended with her into the kitchen, put on his hat and cloak, and taking a cudgel in his hand, departed. As he walked along the road, he resumed the thread of his apostrophe to poor Renzo. “Headstrong mountaineer!”—for that Renzo was such, had been manifest from his pronunciation, countenance, and manners, although he vainly tried to conceal it,—“on a day like this, when by dint of skill and prudence I had kept my hands clean, you must come at the end of it to spoil all I have done! Are there not inns enough in Milan, that you must come to mine! at least, if you had been alone, I would have winked at it for to-night, and made you understand matters to-morrow. But no; my gentleman must come in company, and, to do the thing better, in company with an informer.”

At this moment he perceived a patrole of soldiers approaching; drawing on one side to let them pass, and eyeing them askance, he continued, “There go the fool-punishers. And thou, great booby, because thou saw'st a few people making a little noise, thou must think the world was turned upside down; and on this fine foundation thou hast ruined thyself and would have ruined me; I have done all I could to save thee, now thou must get thyself out of trouble. As if I wanted to know thy name from curiosity! What was it to me whether it were Thaddeus or Bartholomew? I have truly great satisfaction in taking a pen in my hand! I know well enough that there are proclamations which are disregarded; just as if we had need of a mountaineer to tell us that! And dost thou not know, thou fool! what would be done to a poor innkeeper, who should be of thy opinion (since upon them the proclamation bear hardest), and should not inform himself of the name of any one who did him the favour to lodge at his house. Under penalty of whoever of the above-said hosts, tavern keepers, and others, of three hundred crowns,—behold three hundred crowns hatched; and now to spend them well,—two thirds to be applied to the royal chamber, and the other third to the accuser or informer. And in case of inability, five years in the galleys, and greater pecuniary and corporal punishments, at the discretion of his Excellency. Very much obliged for such favours, indeed!” He ended his soliloquy, finding himself at his destined point, the palace of the Capitano di Giustizia.

There, as in all the offices of the secretaries, there was a great deal of business going on; on all sides, persons were employed in issuing orders to ensure the peace of the following day, to take from rebellion every pretext, to cool the audacity of those who were desirous of fresh disorders, and to concentrate power in the hands of those accustomed to exercise it. The number of the soldiers who protected the house of the superintendant was increased; the ends of the streets were defended by large pieces of timber thrown across them; the bakers were ordered to bake bread without intermission; expresses were sent to all the surrounding villages, with orders to send corn into the city; and at every baker's some of the nobility were stationed, to watch over the distribution, and to restrain the discontented by fair words and the authority of their presence. But to give, as they said, a blow to the hoop, and another to the cask, and increase the efficacy of their caresses by a little awe, they took measures to seize some of the seditious, and this was the principal duty of the Capitano di Giustizia. His blood-hounds had been in the field since the commencement of the tumult; and this self-styled Ambrose Fusella was a police officer in disguise, who, having listened to the famous sermon of Renzo, concluded him to be fair game. Finding that he had but newly arrived from his village, he would have conducted him immediately to prison, as the safest inn in the city; but in this, as we have seen, he did not succeed. He could, however, carry to the police certain information of his name, surname, and country, besides many other conjectures; so that when the host arrived to tell what he knew of Renzo, their knowledge was already more precise than his. He entered the accustomed hall, and gave in his deposition, that a stranger had come to lodge at his house, who would not tell his name.

“You have done your duty in giving us the information,” said a notary, laying down his pen; “but we know it already.”

“That is very singular!” thought the host; “you must have a great deal of cunning.”

“And we know also,” continued the notary, “this famous name.”

“The devil! the name also. How do they know that?” thought the host again.

“But,” resumed the notary, with a serious air, “you do not tell all.”

“What is there more to tell?”

“Ah! ah! we know well that this man carried to your house a quantity of stolen bread—bread acquired by theft and sedition.”

“A man comes with bread in his pocket; am I to know where he got it? if it was on my death-bed, I can say, I only saw him have one loaf.”

“Thus it is! you are always excusing and defending yourselves! If we were to take your word for it, you are all honest people. How can you prove that this bread was honestly acquired?”

“Why need I prove it? it is nothing to me. I am an innkeeper.”

“You cannot, however, deny, that this, your customer, had the audacity to complain of the proclamations, and make indecent jokes on the arms of his Excellency.”

“Pardon me, signor; how could he be my customer, when I never saw him before? It was the devil, saving your presence, who sent him to my house. If I had known him, there would have been no need of asking his name, as your honour knows.”

“However, in your inn, and in your presence, seditious and inflammatory conversation has been held; your customers have been riotous, clamorous, and complaining.”

“How would your honour expect me to pay attention to the absurdities uttered by a parcel of brawlers. I attend only to my own affairs, for I am a poor man. And then your honour knows, that those who are lavish of their tongue, are often lavish of their fists, especially when there are many together.”

“Yes, yes, they may have their way now; to-morrow—to-morrow, we will see if the heat is dislodged from their brains. What do you think?”

“I don't know.”

“That the mob will become masters in Milan?”

“Certainly!”

“You shall see, you shall see.”

“I understand—I know the king will be always the king; but he who has taken any thing will keep it. Naturally a poor father of a family has no desire to give back; your honours have the power; that belongs to you.”

“Have you still some people at your house?”

“A number.”

“And this your customer, what is he about? Is he still labouring to excite the people to sedition?”

“This stranger, your honour means; he is gone to sleep.”

“Then you have a number? Well, be careful not to let them go away.”

“Am I to play the constable?” thought the host, but said nothing.

“Return to your house, and be prudent,” resumed the notary.

“I have always been prudent. Your honour can say that I have never made any disturbance.”

“Well, well; but do not think that justice has lost its power.”

“I! Good heavens! I think nothing. I am an innkeeper.”

“The same old tune. Have you nothing more to say?”

“What else would your honour have me say? Truth is one.”

“Well; you have done enough for to-day: but to-morrow, we will see; you must give more full information, and answer all questions that shall be put to you.”

“What information have I to give? I know nothing; I have hardly brains enough to attend to my own affairs.”

“Take care not to let him go away.”

“I hope your honour will remember that I have done my duty. Your honour's humble servant.”

On the following morning, Renzo was still in a sound and deep sleep, when he was suddenly roused by a shaking of the arms, and by a voice at the foot of the bed, crying, “Lorenzo Tramaglino!” He sat up, and rubbing his eyes, perceived a man clothed in black standing at the foot of his bed, and two others, one on each side of the bolster. Between surprise, sleep, and the fumes of the wine, he remained a moment stupified, believing himself to be still dreaming.

“Ah! you have heard at last! Lorenzo Tramaglino,” said the man in black, the notary of the preceding evening. “Up, up; get up, and come with us.”

“Lorenzo Tramaglino!” said Renzo Tramaglino. “What does this mean? What do you want with me? Who has told you my name?”

“Few words, and get up quickly,” said one of the men at his side, seizing him by the arm.

“Oh! oh! what violence is this?” cried Renzo, drawing away his arm. “Host! oh! host!”

“Shall we carry him off in his shirt?” said one of the officers; turning to the notary.

“Did you hear what he said?” said he to Renzo; “we will do so, if you do not rise quickly, and come with us!”

“Why?” demanded Renzo.

“You will hear that from the Capitano di Giustizia.”

“I! I am an honest man; I have done nothing; I am astonished——”

“So much the better for you! so much the better for you! In two words you will be dismissed, and then go about your affairs.”

“Let me go now, then; there is no reason why I should go before the capitano.”

“Come, let us finish the business,” said an officer.

“We shall be obliged to carry him off!” said the other.

“Lorenzo Tramaglino!” said the notary.

“How does your honour know my name?”

“Do your duty,” said he to the men, who attempted to draw Renzo from the bed.

“Oh! don't touch me! I can dress myself.”

“Dress yourself, then, and get up,” said the notary.

“I will,” said Renzo, and he gathered his clothes, scattered here and there on the bed, like the fragments of a shipwreck on the coast. Whilst engaged in the act of dressing, he continued, “but I will not go to the Capitano di Giustizia; I have nothing to do with him: since you put this affront on me, I wish to be conducted to Ferrer; I am acquainted with him; I know he is an honest man, and he is under obligations to me.”

“Yes, yes, my good fellow, you shall be conducted to Ferrer,” replied the notary.

In other circumstances he would have laughed heartily at the absurdity of such a proposition, but he felt that this was not a moment for merriment. On his way to the inn, he had perceived so many people abroad, such a stirring—some collecting in small quantities, others gathering in crowds—that he was not able to determine whether they were the remnants of the old insurrection not entirely suppressed, or the beginnings of a new one. And now, without appearing to do so, he listened, and thought the buzzing increased. He felt haste to be of importance; but he did not dare to take Renzo against his will, lest, finding himself in the street, he might take advantage of public sympathy, and endeavour to escape from his hands. He made a sign to his officers to be patient, and not exasperate the youth; whilst he himself sought to appease him with fair words.

Renzo meanwhile began to have a confused recollection of the events of the preceding day, and to comprehend that the proclamations, name, and surname, were the cause of all this trouble; but how the devil did this man know his name? And what the devil had happened during the night, that they should come to lay hands on one, who, the day before, had such a voice in the assembly, which could not be yet dispersed, because he also heard a growing murmur in the street. He perceived also the agitation which the notary vainly endeavoured to conceal; therefore, to feel his pulse, and clear up his own conjectures, as well as to gain time, he said, “I comprehend the cause of all this, it is on account of the name and surname. Last night, 'tis true, I was a little merry; these hosts have such treacherous wine and, you know, often when wine passes through the channel of speech, it will have its say too. But if that is all the difficulty, I am ready to give you every satisfaction. Besides, you know my name already. Who the devil told it to you?”

“Bravo! my good fellow, bravo!” replied the notary in a tone of encouragement. “I see you are in the right, and you must believe that I am also. I am only following my trade. You are more tractable than others. It is the easiest way to get out of the difficulty quickly. With such an accommodating spirit, you will soon be set at liberty; but my hands are tied, and I cannot release you now, although I would wish to do so. Be of good courage, and come on boldly. When they see who you are—and I will tell—Leave it to me—quick, quick, my good fellow!”

“Ah! you cannot! I understand,” said Renzo. “Shall we pass by the square of the cathedral?”

“Where you choose. We will go the shortest road, that you may be the sooner at liberty,” said he, inwardly cursing his stars at being unable to follow up this mysterious demand of Renzo's, which might have been made the subject of a hundred interrogatories. “Miserable that I am!” thought he, “here is a fellow fallen into my hands, who likes no better fun than to prate. Were there but a little time, he would confess all in the way of friendly discourse, without the aid of rope. Ay! and without perceiving it too. But that he should fall into my hands at such an unlucky moment.—Well, it can't be helped,” thought he, while turning his head and listening to the noise without, “there is no remedy: this will be a hotter day than yesterday!”

That which gave rise to this last thought was an extraordinary uproar in the street, which tempted him to open the window and reconnoitre. There was a concourse of citizens, who, at the order given them by the patrole to separate, had resisted for a while, and then moved off, on all sides, in evident discontent. It was a fatal sign to the eyes of the notary, that the soldiers treated them with much politeness. He closed the window, and remained for a moment undecided, whether he should conduct the enterprise to an end, or, leaving Renzo in the care of the bailiffs, go himself to the Capitano di Giustizia, and relate the whole difficulty. “But,” thought he, “he will tell me I am a poltroon, a coward, and that it was my business to execute orders. We are at the ball; we must dance, it seems. Cursed crowd! what a damned business!” He, however addressed Renzo in a tone of kind entreaty, “Come, my worthy fellow, do let us be off, and make haste.”

Renzo, however, was not without his thoughts. He was almost dressed, with the exception of his doublet, into the pockets of which he was fumbling. “Oh!” said he, regarding the notary significantly, “Oh! I had a letter, and some money here, once, sir!”

“When these formalities are over, all shall be faithfully restored to you. Come, come, let us be off.”

“No, no, no!” said Renzo, shaking his head, “that won't do: I must have what belongs to me, sir. I will render an account of my actions, but I must have what belongs to me.”

“I will show you that I have confidence in you; here they are. And now make haste,” said the notary, drawing from his bosom the sequestered goods, and consigning them, with something like a sigh, to Renzo, who muttered between his teeth, as he put them in his pocket, “You have so much to do with thieves, that you have learned the trade!”

“If I get you once safe out of the house, you shall pay this with interest,” thought the notary.

As Renzo was putting on his hat, the notary made a sign to the officers, that one of them should go before, and the other follow the prisoner; and as they passed through the kitchen, and whilst Renzo was saying, “And this blessed host, where has he fled?” they seized, one his right hand, the other the left, and skilfully slipped over his wrists, hand-fetters, as they were called, which, according to the customs of the times, consisted of a cord, a little longer than the usual size of the fist, which had at the two ends two small pieces of wood. The cord encircled the wrist of the patient; the captor held the pegs in his hand, so that he could, by twisting them, tighten the cord at will, and this enabled him, not only to secure the prisoner, but also to torment him, if restless; and, to ensure this more effectually, the cord was full of knots.

Renzo struggled and exclaimed, “What treachery is this? to an honest man!” But the notary, who had fair words prepared for every occasion, said, “Be patient, they only do their duty. What would you have? It is a mere ceremony. We cannot treat people as we would wish. If we did not obey orders, we should be worse off than you. Be patient.”

As he spoke, the two operators twisted the pegs; Renzo plunged like a skittish horse upon the bit, and cried, “Patience, indeed!”

“But, worthy young man,” said the notary, “it is the only way to come off well in these affairs. It is troublesome, I confess, but it will soon be over; and since I see you so well disposed, I feel an inclination to serve you, and will give you another piece of advice for your good, which is, to pass on quietly, looking neither to right nor left, so as to attract notice. If you do this, no one will pay any attention to you, and you will preserve your honour. In one hour you will be at liberty. There are so many other things to be done, that your business will soon be despatched; and then I will tell them——. You shall have your liberty, and no one will know you have been in the hands of the law. And you,” pursued he, addressing his followers in a tone of severity, “do him no harm, because I take him under my protection. You must do your duty, I know; but remember that this is a worthy and honest youth, who in a little while will be at liberty, and who has a regard for his honour. Let nothing appear but that you are three peaceable men, walking together. You understand me!” and smoothing his brow, and twisting his face into a gracious smile, he said to Renzo, “A little prudence,—do as I tell you; do not look about; trust to one who has your interest at heart! And now let us begone.” And the convoy moved forward.

But of all these fine speeches Renzo believed not a word. He understood very well the fears that prevailed over the mind of the notary, and his exhortations only served to confirm him in his purpose to escape; and to this end to act directly contrary to the advice given him. No one must conclude from this that the notary was an inexperienced knave. On the contrary, he was master of his trade, but at the present moment his spirits were agitated. At another time he would have ridiculed any one for pursuing the measures he had now himself employed, but his agitation had deprived him of his accustomed cunning and self-possession. We would recommend, therefore, to all knaves by trade, to maintain on all occasions their sang froid, or, what is better, never to place themselves in difficult circumstances.

Renzo, then, hardly found himself in the street, when he began to look around, and listen eagerly. There was not, however, an extraordinary concourse of people; and although on the countenance of more than one passer-by you could read an expression of discontent and sedition, yet each one pursued his way in quietness.

“Prudence! prudence!” murmured the notary behind him. “Your honour, young man, your honour.”

But when Renzo heard three men, who were approaching, talk of a bakery, of flour concealed, of justice, he began to make signs to them, and cough in such a manner, as indicated any thing but a cold. They looked attentively at the convoy, and stopped; others who had passed by, turned back, and kept themselves a short distance off.

“Take care; be prudent, my good fellow; do not spoil all; your honour, your reputation,” said the notary in a low voice, but unheeded by Renzo. The men again twisted the pegs.

“Ah! ah! ah!” cried the prisoner. At this cry the crowd thickened around; they gathered from all parts of the street. The convoy was stopped! “He is a wicked fellow,” said the notary in a whisper to those nearest him; “he is a thief taken in the fact. Draw back, and let justice have its way.” But Renzo perceived that the occasion was favourable: he saw the officers pale and almost dead with fright. “If I do not help myself now,” thought he, “so much the worse for me;” and raising his voice, he cried, “My friends; they are carrying me off, because I cried, ‘Bread! and justice!’ yesterday. I have done nothing; I am an honest man! Help me, do not abandon me, my friends.”

He was answered by a light murmur, which soon changed to an unanimous cry in his favour. The officers ordered, requested, and entreated those nearest them to go off, and leave their passage free; but the crowd continued to press around. The officers, at the sight of the danger, left their prisoner, and endeavoured to lose themselves in the throng, for the purpose of escaping without being observed; and the notary desired heartily to do the same, but found it more difficult on account of his black cloak. Pale as death, he endeavoured, by twisting his body to work his way through the crowd. He studied to appear a stranger, who, passing accidentally, had found himself in the crowd like a bit of straw in the ice; and finding himself face to face with a man who looked at him more intently and sternly than the rest, he composed his countenance to a smile, and asked, “What is this confusion?”

“Oh! you ugly raven!” replied he. “A raven! a raven!” resounded from all sides. To the cries they added threats, so that, finally, partly with his own legs, partly with the elbows of others, he succeeded in obtaining a release from the squabble.
CHAPTER XVI.

“Fly, fly, honest man! Here is a convent, there is a church; this way! this way!” was shouted to Renzo from every side. The advice was not necessary; from the moment that he conceived the hope of extricating himself from the talons of the police, he had determined, if he succeeded, to depart immediately, not only from the city, but the dukedom. “Because,” thought he, “however they may have procured it, they have my name on their books; and with name and surname, they will take me again if they choose to do so.” As to an asylum, he was determined not to have recourse to it, but in the last extremity. “Because,” thought he, “if I can be a bird of the woods, I will not be a bird of the cage.” He then determined to seek his cousin Bartolo in the territory of Bergamo, who had often urged him to establish himself there; but to find the road was the difficulty! In a part of the city entirely unknown to him, he did not know which gate led to Bergamo; nor if he had known it, would he have been able to find it. He thought a moment of asking directions from his liberators, but he had for some time had strange suspicions with regard to the obliging sword-cutler, father of four children; so that he did not dare openly declare his design, lest, amidst the crowd, there might be another of the same stamp. He determined therefore to hasten from this spot, and ask the way when he should arrive at a place where there would be nothing to fear from the curiosity or the character of others. He said to his liberators, “Thanks, a thousand thanks! friends! may Heaven reward you!” and quitting the crowd through a passage made for him, he ran down lanes and narrow streets, without knowing whither.

When he thought himself sufficiently removed from the scene of peril, he slackened his steps, and began to look around for some countenance which might inspire him with confidence enough to make his enquiries. But the enquiry would of itself be suspicious; time pressed; the police, recovering from their fright, would, without doubt, pursue their fugitive; the noise of his escape might have reached even there; and in so great a multitude Renzo might pass many judgments in physiognomy before he should find one which seemed favourable. After suffering many to pass whose appearance was unpropitious, he at last summoned courage to address a man, who seemed in such haste, that Renzo deemed he would not hesitate to answer his questions, in order to get rid of him. “Will you be so good, sir, as to tell me through which gate to go to Bergamo?”

“To Bergamo? through the eastern gate. Take this street to the left; you will come to the square of the cathedral; then——”

“That is enough, sir; I know the way after that; God reward you!” And he went on hastily by the way pointed out to him, and arrived at the square of the cathedral. He crossed it, passed by the remains of the extinguished bonfire, at which he had assisted the day before; the bake-house of the Crutches half demolished, and still guarded by soldiers; and finally, reaching the convent of the capuchins, and looking at the door of the church, he said to himself, sighing, “The friar gave me good advice yesterday, when he told me it would be best for me to wait patiently in the church.” He stopped a moment, and seeing that many persons guarded the gate through which he had to pass, he felt a repugnance to confront them; and hesitated whether it would not be his wisest plan to seek this asylum and deliver his letter. But he soon resumed courage, saying, “A bird of the woods as long as I can be. Who knows me? Certainly the police cannot be waiting for me at all the gates.” He looked around, therefore, and perceiving that no one appeared to notice him, and, whistling as he went, as if from carelessness, he approached the gate. A company of custom-house officers, with a reinforcement of Spanish soldiers, were stationed precisely at its entrance, to keep out persons from abroad, who might be attracted, by the noise of the tumult, to rush into the city; their attention was therefore directed beyond the gate, and Renzo, taking advantage of this, contrived, with a quiet and demure look, to pass through, as if he were some peaceful traveller; but his heart beat violently. He pursued a path on the right, to avoid the high road, and for some distance did not dare to look behind him.

On! on! he passed hamlets and villages, without asking the name of them; hoping that, whilst he was removing from Milan, he was approaching Bergamo. He looked behind him from time to time, while pressing onwards, and rubbing first one wrist, then the other, which bore the red marks from the painful pressure of the manacles. His thoughts were a confused medley of repentance, anxiety, and resentment; and he wearily retraced the circumstances of the preceding night, to ascertain what had plunged him into these difficulties, and above all, how they came to know his name. His suspicions rested on the cutler, whose curiosity he well remembered, and he had also a confused recollection that after his departure he had continued to talk, but with whom, his memory did not serve to inform him. The poor fellow was lost in these speculations; the past was a chaos.

He then endeavoured to form some plan for the future; but all other considerations were soon swallowed up in the necessity which he was under of ascertaining the road; and to do this, he was obliged to address himself to some one. He was reluctant to name Bergamo, lest it might excite suspicion: why it should, he knew not; but his mind was a prey to vague apprehensions of evil. However, he could not do otherwise; and, as at Milan, he accosted the first passenger whose appearance promised favourably.

“You are out of the road,” replied the traveller; and directed him to a path by which he might regain the high road. Renzo thanked him, and followed the direction, with the intention, however, of keeping the high road in sight, without exposing himself to hazard by travelling on it. The project was more easily conceived than executed; in pursuing a zigzag course, from right to left, and left to right, and endeavouring still to keep the general direction of the way, he had probably traversed twelve miles, when he was only six miles from Milan; and as to Bergamo, it was a chance if he was not farther from it, than when he began his journey. He reflected that this would never do, and he must seek some other expedient; that which occurred to him, was to inform himself of the name of some village near the frontier, which he would reach by crossroads, and asking the way to that, be enabled to avoid the mention of this dreaded Bergamo, which seemed to him so likely to cause distrust and suspicion.

Whilst he was reflecting on the best method of pursuing this plan without awakening conjectures, he saw a green branch hanging from the door of a lonely cottage, some distance beyond a village; and as he had for some time felt the need of refreshment, he thought he could now kill two birds with one stone, and therefore entered the humble dwelling. There was no one within, but an old woman, with her distaff by her side, and spindle in her hand. He asked for a mouthful to eat; she offered him some stracchino[27], and some wine. He accepted the food, but refused the wine; of which he felt an intuitive horror since the events of the preceding night. The old woman then began to assail her guest with enquiries of his trade, his journey, and of the news from Milan, of the disturbances of which she had heard some rumours. To her question, “Where are you going?” he replied, “I am obliged to go to many places, but if I find a moment of time, I should like to stop awhile at the village on the road to Bergamo, near the frontier, but in the territory of Milan—what do they call it?—There must be some village there,” thought he.

“Gorgonzola, you mean,” replied the old woman.

“Gorgonzola,” repeated Renzo, as if to fix it in his memory, “is it far from here?”

“I don't know for certain; perhaps ten or twelve miles. If one of my children were here, they could tell you.”

“And do you think I could reach there by keeping on these pleasant paths, without taking the high road, where there is so much dust? such a quantity of dust! It is so long since we have had any rain!”

“I think you can. You can ask at the first village to the right,”—naming it.

“Thank you,” said Renzo, carrying off the remains of his bread, which was much coarser than what he had lately eaten from the foot of the Cross of St. Dionysius; and paying the bill, departed. He took the road to the right, and with the name of Gorgonzola in his mouth, from village to village, he succeeded in reaching it an hour before sunset.

He had on his way intended to halt here for some more substantial refreshment; he felt also the need of sleep; but rather than indulge himself in this, he would have dropped dead on the road. His design was to inform himself, at the inn, of the distance from the Adda, to contrive to obtain some direction to the cross paths which led to it, and after having eaten, to go on his way. Born at the second source of this river, he had often heard that at a certain point, and for some distance, its waters marked the confines of the Milanese and Venetian states. He had no precise idea of the spot where this boundary commenced, but, at this time, the principal matter was to reach the river. Provided he could not accomplish it by daylight, he decided to travel as long as the darkness and his strength would permit, and then to wait the approach of day in a field, among brambles, or any where, where it should please God, an inn excepted. After advancing a few steps in Gorgonzola, he saw a sign, and entering the house, asked the host for a mouthful to eat, and a half-pint of wine, his horror of which had been subdued by his excessive fatigue. “I pray you to be in haste,” added he, “for I must continue my journey immediately.” And he said this, not only because it was the truth, but from fear that the host, imagining he was going to lodge there, might ask him his name, surname, and whence he came, and what was his business!

The host replied that he should have what he requested, and Renzo seated himself at the end of a bench near the door.

There were in the room some idle people of the neighbourhood, who, after having discussed the great news from Milan of the preceding day, wondered how affairs were going on; as the circumstances of the rebellion had left their curiosity unsatisfied as to its termination; a sedition neither suppressed nor successful; suspended rather than terminated; an unfinished work; the end of an act rather than of a drama. One of them detached himself from the company, and, approaching the new-comer, asked him, “If he came from Milan?”

“I?” said Renzo, endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a reply.

“You; if the enquiry be lawful.”

Renzo, contracting his mouth, made a sort of inarticulate sound, “Milan, from what I hear—from what they say—is not a place where one would go now, unless necessity required it.”

“The tumult continues, then?” asked he, with eagerness.

“One must have been on the spot, to know if it were so,” said Renzo.

“But do you not come from Milan?”

“I come from Liscate,” replied the youth, who, in the mean while had prepared his answer. He had, indeed, come from that place, as he had passed through it. He had learned its name from a traveller who had mentioned it, as the first village on his road to Gorgonzola.

“Oh!” said his interrogator, “I wish you had come from Milan. But patience—and did you hear nothing from Milan at Liscate?”

“It is very possible that others knew something,” replied our mountaineer; “but I have heard nothing.”

The inquisitive person rejoined his companions.

“How far is it from this to the Adda?” said Renzo to the host, in a low careless tone, as he set before him something to eat.

“To the Adda? to cross the river?”

“That is—yes—to the Adda.”

“Would you cross the bridge of Cassano, or the ferry of Canonica?”

“Where are they?—I ask simply from curiosity.”

“Ah! I name them because they are the places chosen by honest people, who are willing to give an account of themselves.”

“That is right. And how far are they?”

“It must be about six miles.”

“Six miles! I did not know that,” said he. “But,” resuming an air of indifference, “if one wished to shorten the distance, are there not other places, where one might cross?”

“Certainly,” replied the host, looking at him with an expression of malignant curiosity, which restrained Renzo from any further enquiry. He drew the dish towards him, and looking at the decanter the host had put on the table, said, “Is this wine pure?”

“As gold. Ask all the inhabitants of the village, and hereabouts. But you can judge yourself.” So saying, he joined the other customers.

“Curse the hosts!” said Renzo, in his heart. “The more I know of them, the worse I find them.”

He began to eat, listening at the same time to the conversation, to learn what was thought, in this place, of the events in which he had acted so principal a part; and also to discover if there were not some honest man among the company, of whom a poor youth might ask his way without fear of being compelled in return to tell his business.

“But,” said one, “to-morrow, at the latest, we shall know something from Milan.”

“I am sorry I did not go to Milan this morning,” said another.

“If you will go to-morrow, I will go with you,” said two or three.

“That which I wish to know,” replied the first speaker, “is, if these gentlemen of Milan will think of poor people abroad, or if they will only think of obtaining advantages for themselves. You know how they are. The citizens are proud—they think only of themselves; the villagers are treated as if they were not Christians.”

“We have mouths also, to eat, and to give our reasons,” said another in a voice as timid as the remark was daring, “and since the thing has begun——” But he did not think to finish his sentence.

“It is not only in Milan, that they conceal grain,” said another, with a mysterious air—when suddenly they heard approaching the trampling of a horse. They ran to the door, and recognising the person who arrived, they went out to receive him. It was a merchant of Milan, who, going frequently to Bergamo on business, was accustomed to pass the night at this inn, and as he had almost always found there the same company, he had formed an acquaintance with all of them. They crowded around him—one held the bridle, another the stirrup. “You are welcome.”

“And I am glad to find you all here.”

“Have you made a good journey?”

“Very good. And you all, how do you do?”

“Well, well. What news from Milan?”

“Ah! there is great news truly,” said the merchant, dismounting, and leaving his horse in the care of a boy. “But,” continued he, entering the house with the company, “perhaps you know by this time better than I do.”

“Truly, we know nothing.”

“Is it possible?—Well, you will hear fine news, or rather bad news. Eh! host! is my bed unoccupied? It is well. A glass of wine, and my usual dish. Quick, quick! because I must go to bed early, in order to rise early, as I must be at Bergamo to dinner. And you,” pursued he, seating himself at the table opposite to Renzo, who continued silent and attentive, “you know nothing of the mischief of yesterday!”

“We heard about yesterday.”

“I knew that you must have heard it, being here always on guard to watch travellers.”

“But to-day? What has been done to-day?”

“Ah! to-day! Then you know nothing of to-day?”

“Nothing at all. No one has passed.”

“Then let me wet my lips, and I will tell you what has happened to-day.” He filled the glass, swallowed its contents, and continued: “To-day, my dear friends, little was wanting to make the tumult worse than yesterday. And I can hardly believe that I am here to tell you, for I had nearly given up all thoughts of coming, that I might stay to guard my shop.”

“What was the matter, then?” said one of his auditors.

“What was the matter? I will tell you.” And beginning to eat, he at the same time pursued his relation; the company standing on his right and left, listened with open mouths and ears. Renzo, without appearing to hear him, was, in fact, the most attentive of all; and ate his last mouthful very, very slowly. “This morning, then, those vagabonds who made such a hurly-burly yesterday, met at the points agreed on, and began to run from street to street, sending forth cries in order to collect a crowd. You know it is with such people, as when one sweeps a house; the more you sweep, the more dirt you have. When they thought there were people enough, they approached the house of the superintendant of provision, as if the atrocities they committed yesterday were not enough, to a gentleman of his character. Oh! the rascals! And the abuse they bestowed on him! All invention and falsehood: he is a worthy punctual man; I can say it, for I know; and I furnish him cloth for his liveries. They hurried then towards his house—such a mob! such faces! They passed before my shop. Such faces—the Jews of the Via Crucis are nothing to them. And the blasphemies they uttered! enough to make one stop one's ears, had it not been for fear of observation. Their intention was to plunder, but——”

“But?” said they all.

“But they found the street barricadoed, and a company of musketeers on guard. When they saw this ceremony—what would you have done?”

“Turn back.”

“Certainly; and that is precisely what they did. But see if the devil did not carry them there. When they came on the Cordusio, they saw the baker that they had wanted to plunder the day before; and what do you think they were doing at this baker's? They were distributing bread to purchasers; the first gentlemen of the land were there, watching over its distribution. The mob, instigated by the devil, rushed upon them furiously, and, in the twinkling of an eye, gentlemen, bakers, purchasers, bread, counters, benches, loaves, bags, flour, all topsy-turvy.”

“And the musketeers?”

“The musketeers had the vicar's house to guard. One can't sing and carry the cross too. It was done in the twinkling of an eye, I say. Plunder, plunder; every thing was carried off. And then they proposed the amusement of yesterday, to burn what remained, in the square, and make a bonfire. And immediately they began, the rascals! to drag every thing out of the house, when one among them——Guess what fine proposal he made!”

“What?”

“What! to gather every thing in the shop in a heap, and set fire to it and the shop at the same time. No sooner said than done——”

“Did they set fire to it?”

“Wait a bit. An honest man in the neighbourhood had an inspiration from Heaven. He ran into the house, ascended the stairs, took a crucifix, and hung it in front of a window; took from the head of the bed two wax candles which had been blessed, lit them, and placed them right and left of the crucifix. The crowd looked up; there is a little fear of God yet, in Milan, it must be confessed; the crowd retired—a few would have been sacrilegious enough to set fire to paradise itself; but seeing the rest not of their opinion, they were obliged to be quiet. Guess what happened then! All the lords of the cathedral in procession, with the cross elevated, and in pontifical robes; and my lord the arch-priest began to preach on one side, and my lord the penitenziere on the other, and then others here and there: ‘But, honest people, what would you do? Is this the example you set to your children? Return to your homes; you shall have bread at a fair price; you can see, yourselves, the rate is affixed at every corner!’”

“Was it true?”

“Can you doubt it? Do you think the lords of the cathedral would come in their robes and declare falsehoods?”

“And what did the people do?”

“By little and little they dispersed; they ran to the corners of the streets; the rate was there for those who knew how to read. Eight ounces of bread for a penny!”

“What good fortune.”

“The vine is fine, if its fruitfulness continues. Do you know how much flour has been consumed since yesterday? As much as would supply the dukedom two months.”

“And have they made no good law for us country people?”

“What they have done at Milan is for the city alone. I know not what to tell you; for you, it must be as God shall direct. The tumult has entirely ceased for the present; I have not told you all yet. Here is the best——”

“What! is there any thing more?”

“Yesterday evening, or this morning, they have arrested some of the leaders, and they have been told that four will be hung. Hardly was this known, when every one betook himself home by the shortest road, so as not to be the fifth. Milan, when I left it, resembled a convent of monks.”

“But will they really hang them?”

“Undoubtedly, and very soon,” replied the merchant.

“And what will the people do?”

“The people will go to see them,” said the merchant. “They desired so much to see a man hung, that the rascals were about to satisfy their curiosity on the superintendent of provision. They will see instead, four rogues, accompanied by capuchins and friars of the buona morte[28]; well, they have richly deserved it. It is a providence, you see; it was a necessary thing. They had begun to enter the shops, and take what they wanted, without putting their hand to their purse. If they had been suffered to go on their own way, after bread, it would have been wine, and then something else—and I assure you, as an honest man, keeping a shop, it was not a very agreeable idea.”

“Assuredly not,” said one of his auditors.

“Assuredly not,” repeated the others in chorus.

“And,” continued the merchant, “it had been in preparation a long while. There was a league, you know?”

“A league!”

“A league. Cabals instigated by the Navarrese, by that cardinal of France, you know, who has a half-barbarous name, and who every day offers some new affront to the crown of Spain. But he aims chiefly at Milan, because he knows, the knave, that the strength of the king lies there.”

“Indeed!”

“Would you have a proof of it? Those who made the most noise were strangers; people who were never seen before in Milan. I have forgotten, after all, to tell you something I heard; one of these had been caught in an inn——”

When this chord was touched, poor Renzo felt a cold shiver, and could with difficulty conceal his agitation. No one however perceived it, and the orator proceeded:—

“They do not yet know whence he came, by whom he was sent, nor what kind of man he was; but he was certainly one of the leaders. Yesterday, in the height of the tumult, he played the devil; then, not content with that, he began to exhort, and propose a fine thing truly! to murder all the lords! Rascal! how would poor people live, if the lords were killed? He was taken, however, and they found on him an enormous packet of letters, after which they were taking him to prison. But what do you think? his companions, who were keeping watch round the inn, came in great force, and delivered him. The rogue!”

“And what has become of him?”

“It is not known. He has escaped, or is concealed in Milan. These people find lodging and concealment any where, although they have neither house nor home of their own. The devil helps them; but they are sometimes taken in the snare, when they least expect it. When the pear is ripe, it must fall. It is well known that these letters are in the hands of government, that they contain an account of the whole plot, that many people are implicated, that they have turned the city upside down, and would have done much worse. Some say the bakers are rogues, and so say I: but they ought to be hanged at least in a legal manner. There certainly is corn concealed; and the government ought to have spies and find it out, and hang up all that keep it back in company with the bakers; and if they don't, all the city ought to remonstrate again and again, but never allow the villainous practice of entering shops and warehouses for plunder.”

The little that Renzo had eaten had become poison. It appeared like an age before he dared rise to quit. He felt nailed to the spot. To have moved from the inn and the village, in the midst of the conversation, would have incurred suspicion. He determined to wait till the babbler should cease to speak of him and apply to some other subject.

“And I,” said one of the company, “who have some experience, know that a tumult like this is no place for an honest man; therefore I have not suffered my curiosity to conquer me, and have remained quietly at home.”

“And did I move?” said another.

“And I,” added a third, “if by any chance I had been at Milan, I would have left my business unfinished, and returned home.”

At this moment the host approached the corner of the table, to see how the stranger came on. Renzo gathered courage to speak, asked for his bill, settled it, and rapidly crossed the threshold, trusting himself to the guardian care of a kind Providence.
CHAPTER XVII.

The discourse of the merchant had plunged our poor Renzo into inexpressible agitation and alarm; there was no doubt that his adventure was noised abroad—that people were in search of him? Who could tell how many bailiffs were in pursuit of him? Who could tell what orders had been given to watch at the villages, inns, and along the roads? True it was, that two only of the officers were acquainted with his person, and he didn't bear his name stamped on his forehead. Yet he had heard strange stories of fugitives being discovered by their suspicious air, or some unexpected mark; in short, he was alarmed at every shadow.

Although at the moment he quitted Gorgonzola, the bells struck the Ave Maria, and the increasing darkness diminished his danger, he unwillingly took the high road, with the intention, however, of entering the first path which should appear to him to lead in the right direction. He met some travellers, but, his imagination filled with apprehensions, he dared not interrogate them. “The host called it six miles,” said he; “if, in travelling through by-paths, I make it eight or ten, these good limbs will not fail me, I know. I am certainly not going towards Milan, and must therefore be approaching the Adda. If I keep on, sooner or later I must arrive there; the Adda has a voice sufficiently loud to be heard at some distance, and when I hear it, there will be no longer any need of direction. If there is a boat there, I shall cross immediately; if not, I will wait until morning in a field, upon the ground, like the sparrows, which will be far better than a prison.”

He saw a cross-road open to the left, and he pursued it: “I play the devil!” continued he, “I assassinate the lords! A packet of letters! My companions keeping watch! I would give something to meet this merchant face to face, on the other side of the Adda; (Oh! when shall I reach the beautiful stream?) I would ask him politely where he picked up that fine story. Know, my good sir, that, devil as I am, it was I who aided Ferrer, and like a good Christian saved your superintendent of provisions from a rough joke that those ruffians, my friends, were about to play on him. Ay, while you were keeping watch over your shop——and that enormous packet of letters—in the hands of the government. See, sir, here it is; a single letter, written by a worthy man, a monk; a hair of whose beard is worth——but in future learn to speak with more charity of your neighbours.” However, after a while, these thoughts of the poor traveller gave way to more urgent considerations of his present difficulties; he no longer feared pursuit or discovery; but darkness, solitude, and fatigue combined to distress him and retard his progress. A chill north wind penetrated his light clothing, his wedding suit; and, uncomfortable and disheartened, he wandered on, in hopes of finding some place where he might obtain concealment and repose for the night.

He passed through villages, but did not dare ask shelter; the dogs howled at his approach, and induced him to quicken his steps. At single houses near the road-side his fatigue tempted him to knock for shelter; but the apprehension of being saluted with the cry of “Help, thieves! robbers!” banished the idea from his mind. Leaving the cultivated country, he found himself in a plain, covered with fern and broom; and thinking this a favourable symptom of the near vicinity of the river, he followed the path across it. When he had advanced a few steps, he listened, but in vain. The desolation of the place increased the depression of his spirits. Strange forms and apparitions, the birth of former tales and legends, began to haunt his imagination; and to drive them away he began to chant the prayers for the dead. He passed through a thicket of plum-trees and oaks, and found himself on the borders of a wood; he conquered his repugnance to enter it, but as he proceeded into its depths, every object excited his apprehensions. Strange forms appeared beneath the bushes; and the shade of the trees, trembling on his moon-lit path, with the crackling of the dead leaves between his footsteps, inspired him with dread. He would have hastened through the perilous passage, but his limbs refused their office; the wind blew cold and sharp, and penetrating his weakened frame, almost subdued its small remains of vigour. His senses, affected by undefined horrors, appeared to be leaving him; aroused to his danger, he made a violent effort to regain some degree of resolution, in order to return through the wood, and seek shelter in the last village he had passed through, even if it should be in an inn! As he stopped for a moment, before putting his design in execution, the wind brought a new sound to his ear—the murmur of running water. Intently listening, to ascertain if his senses did not deceive him, he cried out, “It is the Adda!” His fatigue vanished, his pulse returned, his blood flowed freely through his veins, his fears disappeared; and guided by the friendly sound, he went forward. He soon reached the extremity of the plain, and found himself on the edge of a steep precipice, whence looking downward, he discovered, through the bushes, the long-desired river, and, on the other side of it, villages scattered here and there, with hills in the distance; and on the summit of one of these a whitish spot, which in the dimness he took to be a city; Bergamo certainly! He descended the declivity, and throwing aside the bushes with his hands, looked beyond them, to spy if some friendly bark were moving on the flood, or if he could not, by listening, hear the sound of oars cleaving the water; but he saw, he heard nothing. If it had been any stream less than the Adda, he would have attempted to ford it, but this he well knew to be impracticable.

He was uncertain what plan to pursue: to lie down on the grass for the next six hours, and wait until morning, exposed to the north wind and the damps of the night; or to continue walking to and fro, to protect himself from the cold, until the day should dawn: neither of these held out much prospect of comfort. He suddenly recollected to have seen, in a neighbouring part of the uncultivated heath, a cascinotto;—this was the name given by the peasants of the Milanese to cabins covered with straw, constructed with the trunks and branches of trees, and the crevices filled with mud, where they were in the habit of placing the crop, gathered during the day, until a more convenient opportunity for removing it; they were therefore abandoned except at such seasons. Renzo found his way thither, pushed open the door, and perceiving a bundle of straw on the ground, thought that sleep, even in such a place, would be very welcome. Before, however, throwing himself on the bed Providence had provided for him, he kneeled, and returned thanks for the blessing, and for all the assistance which had been this day afforded him, and then implored forgiveness for the errors of the previous day; then gathering the straw around him as some defence against the cold, he closed his eyes to sleep; but sleep was not so soon to visit our poor traveller. Confused images began to throng his fancy; the merchant, the notary, the bailiffs, the cutler, the host, Ferrer, the superintendent, the company at the inn, the crowds in the streets, assailed his imagination by turns; then came the thought of Don Abbondio, Roderick, Lucy, Agnes, and the good friar. He remembered the paternal counsels of the latter, and reflected with shame and remorse on his neglect of them; and what bitter retrospection did the image of Lucy produce! and Agnes! poor Agnes! how ill had she been repaid for her motherly solicitude on his behalf! an outcast from her home, solitary, uncertain of the future, reaping misery from what seemed to promise the happiness of her declining years! Poor Renzo! what a night didst thou pass! what an apartment! what a bed for a matrimonial couch! tormented, too, with apprehensions of the future! “I submit to the will of God,” said he, speaking aloud, “to the will of God! He does only that which is right; I accept it all as a just chastisement for my sins. Lucy, however, is so good! the Lord will not long afflict her with suffering.”

In the mean time he despaired of obtaining any repose; the cold was insupportable; his teeth chattered; he ardently wished for day, and measured with impatience the slow progress of the hours; this he was enabled to do, as he heard, every half hour, in the deep silence, the heavy sound of some distant clock, probably that of Trezzo. When the time arrived which he had fixed on for his departure, half benumbed with exposure to the night air, he stretched his stiffened limbs, and opening the door of the cascinotto, looked out, to ascertain if any one were near, and finding all silent around, he resumed his journey along the path he had quitted.

The sky announced a beautiful day; the setting moon shone pale in an immense field of azure, which, towards the east, mingled itself lightly with the rosy dawn. Near the horizon were scattered clouds of various hues and forms; it was, in fact, the sky of Lombardy, beautiful, brilliant, and calm. If Renzo had had a mind at ease, he would no doubt have stopped to contemplate this splendid ushering in of day, so different from that which he had been accustomed to witness amidst his mountains; but his thoughts were otherwise occupied. He reached the brow of the precipice where he had stood the preceding night, and looking below, perceived, through the bushes, a fisherman's bark, which was slowly stemming the current, near the shore. He descended the precipice, and standing on the bank, made a sign to the fisherman to approach. He intended to do this with a careless air, as if it were of little importance, but in spite of himself, his manner was half supplicatory. The fisherman, after having for a moment surveyed the course of the water, as if to ascertain the practicability of reaching the shore, directed the boat towards it; before it touched the bank, Renzo, who was standing on the water's edge, awaiting its approach, seized the prow, and jumped into it.

“Do me a service, and I will pay you for it,” said he; “I wish to cross to the other shore.”

The fisherman having divined his object, had already turned his boat in that direction. Renzo, perceiving another oar in the bottom of the bark, stooped to take it.

“Softly, softly,” said the fisherman. But seeing with what skill the young man managed the oar, “Ah! ah!” added he, “you know the trade.”

“A very little,” replied Renzo, and he continued to row with a vigour and skill beyond that of a mere amateur in the art. With all his efforts, however, the bark moved slowly; the current, setting strong against it, drove it continually from the line of its direction, and impeded the rapidity of its course. New perplexities presented themselves to the mind of Renzo; now that the Adda was almost passed, he began to fear that it might not, at this place, serve for the boundary between the states, and that, this obstacle surmounted, there would yet be others remaining. He spoke to the fisherman, and pointing to the white spot he had noticed the night before, and which was now much more distinct, “Is that Bergamo?” said he.

“The city of Bergamo,” replied the fisherman.

“And the other shore, does it belong to Bergamo?”

“It is the territory of St. Mark.”

“Long live St. Mark!” cried Renzo. The fisherman made no reply.

The boat reached the shore, at last; Renzo thanked God in his heart, as he stepped upon it; and turning to the fisherman took from his pocket a berlinga and gave it to him. The man took it in silence, and with a significant look, placed his forefinger on his lip; and saying, “A good journey to you,” returned to his employment.

In order to account for the prompt and discreet civility of this man towards a perfect stranger, we must inform the reader, that he was accustomed to render similar favours to smugglers and outlaws, not so much for the sake of the little gain which accrued to him thereby, as not to create enemies among these classes of people. He rendered these services, therefore, when he was sure of not being seen by the custom-house officers, bailiffs, or spies. Thus he endeavoured to act with an impartiality, which should give offence to neither party.

Renzo stopped a moment to contemplate the shore he had quitted, and where he had suffered so much; “I am at last safely beyond it,” was his first thought; then the remembrance of those he had left behind rushed over his mind, overwhelming it with regret and shame; for, with the calm and virtuous image of Lucy, came the recollection of his extravagances in Milan.

He shook off, however, these oppressive thoughts, and went on, taking the direction of the whitish mass on the declivity of the mountain, until he should meet some one who could direct him on his way. And now with what a different and careless air he accosted travellers! he hesitated no more, he pronounced boldly the name of the place where his cousin lived, to ask the way to it; from the information given him by the first traveller he met, he found that he had still nine miles to travel.

His journey was not agreeable. Without referring to his own causes of trouble, Renzo was affected every moment by the sight of painful and distressing objects; so that he foresaw, that he should find in this country the poverty he had left in his own. All along the way he was assailed by mendicants,—mendicants of necessity, not of choice,—peasants, mountaineers, tradesmen, whole families reduced to poverty, and to the necessity of begging their bread. This sight, besides the compassion it excited, made him naturally recur to his own prospects.

“Who knows,” thought he, mournfully, “if I shall find work to do? perhaps things are not as they were in preceding years. Bartolo wishes me well, I know; he is a good fellow; he has made money; he has invited me many times to come to him; I am sure he will not abandon me. And then Providence has aided me until now; and will continue to do so.”

Meanwhile, the walk had sharpened his appetite; he could indeed have well waited to the end of his journey, which was only two miles farther, but he did not like to make his first appearance before his cousin as a hungry beggar; he therefore drew all his wealth from his pocket, and counting it on the palm of his hand, found that he had more than sufficient to procure a slight repast; after paying for which, he would still have a few pence remaining.

As he came out of the inn at which he had rested, to proceed on his journey, he saw, lying near the door, two women: the one was elderly, and the other more youthful, with an infant in her arms, which was in vain seeking sustenance from its exhausted mother; both were of the complexion of death: by them stood a man, whose countenance and limbs gave signs of former vigour; now lost from long inanition. All three stretched forth their hands, but spoke not—what prayer could be so moving as their appearance. Renzo sighed; “There is a Providence,” said he, as he placed in the nearest hand the last remnant of his wealth.

The slight repast he had made, and the good deed he had performed (for we are composed of body and soul), had equally tended to refresh and invigorate him. If, to afford relief to these unhappy persons, Providence had kept in reserve the last farthing of a fugitive stranger, would he leave the wants of that stranger unsupplied? He looked with renewed hope to the future; he pictured to himself the return of abundant harvests, and in the mean time he had his cousin Bartolo and his own industry to depend on, and moreover he had left at home a small sum of money, the fruit of his economy, which he could send for, if needed. “Then,” said he, “plenty will eventually return, and trade will be profitable again; the Milanese workmen will be in demand, and can set a high price on their labour; I shall have more than enough to satisfy my wants, and can lay by money, and can furnish my nice house, and then write to Agnes and Lucy to come—and then—But why wait for this? We should have been obliged to live, had we remained at home; we should have been obliged to live during this winter, upon my little savings, and we can do the same here. There are curates every where, and they can come shortly. Oh! what joy will it be to walk together on this same road; to go to the borders of the Adda, where I will point out to them the place where I embarked, the woods through which I passed, the spot where I stood watching for a boat.”

He reached at last the village of his cousin; at its entrance, he saw a very high house, with numerous windows, and perceived it to be a silk manufactory; he entered, and amidst the noise of the water and machinery loudly demanded, “if Bartolo Castagneri was within?”

“Signor Bartolo? there he is.”

“Signor! that's a good sign,” thought Renzo. He perceived his cousin, and ran towards him, exclaiming, “I am come at last!” Bartolo made an exclamation of surprise, and embraced him; he then took him into another chamber, apart from the noise of the machinery and the notice of the inquisitive, and said, “I am glad to see you, but you are a droll fellow. I have invited you many times to come hither; you have always refused, and now choose a most unfavourable moment.”

“What shall I say to you? I have not now come of my own free will,” said Renzo; and he briefly, and with much emotion, related the mournful story.

“That's another affair truly,” said Bartolo. “Poor Renzo! you have relied on me, and I will not abandon you. To say truth, workmen are not in much demand at present; and it is with difficulty that those already engaged are kept by their employers. But my master regards me, and he has money; and besides, without boasting, we are equally dependent on each other—he has the capital, and I the skill, such as it is! I am his first workman, his factotum! Poor Lucy Mondella! I remember her as if it was but yesterday that I last saw her! An excellent girl! always so modest at church; and if you passed by her cottage—I see it now, the little cottage beyond the village, with a large fig-tree against the wall——”

“No, no,” said Renzo, “do not speak of it.”

“I meant to say, that if you passed it, you always heard the noise of her reel. And Don Roderick! even before I left, showed symptoms of his character; but now, it seems, he plays the devil outright, until God shall put a bridle on his neck. Well, as I said, we suffer here also the consequences of scarce harvests.—But, apropos, are you not hungry?”

“It is not long since I have eaten,” said Renzo.

“And how are you off for money?” Renzo extended the palm of his hand and shook his head. “No matter,” said Bartolo: “I have plenty. Cheer up; things will change for the better soon, and then you can repay me.”

“I have a small sum at home, and I will send for it.”

“Well, in the mean while, depend on me. God has given me wealth to spend for others, and above all, for my relations and friends.”

“I knew that you would befriend me,” said Renzo, affectionately pressing his cousin's hand.

“Well, what a fuss they have made at Milan,” continued Bartolo; “the people seem to me to be mad. The report has reached us, but I shall be glad to know the particulars from you. I think we shall have enough to talk about, shall we not? Here, however, things are conducted with more judgment. The city purchased two thousand loads of corn from a merchant of Venice; the corn comes from Turkey. Now, what do you think happened? The governors of Verona and Brescia forbade the transit of the corn. What did the people of Bergamo do then, do you think? They sent to Venice a man that knew how to talk, I can tell you: he went to the doge, and made a speech which they say deserves to be printed! Immediately an order was sent to let the corn pass: the governors were obliged to obey. The country, too, has been thought of. Another good man informed the senate that the people here were famishing, and the senate granted us four thousand bushels of millet, which makes very good bread. And then, if there is no bread, you and I can eat meat; God has given me wealth I tell you. Now I will conduct you to my patron. I have often spoken of you to him; he will make you welcome. He is a native of Bergamo, a man of an excellent disposition. 'Tis true, he did not expect you at this time, but when he learns your story—And then he knows how to value skilful workmen, because scarcity lasts but a little while, and business must finally go on.—But I must hint to you one thing; do you know what name they give to us Milanese in this country?”

“What name they give us?”

“They call us simpletons.”[29]

“That is certainly not a very agreeable name.”

“What matters it? Whoever is born in the territory of Milan, and would gain his living in that of Bergamo, must put up with it. As to the people here, they call a Milanese a simpleton as freely as they call a gentleman sir.”

“They say so, I suppose, to those who will suffer it.”

“My good fellow, if you are not disposed to submit to be called simpleton, till it becomes familiar to your taste, you must not expect to live in Bergamo. You would always be obliged to carry your knife in hand; and when you had killed three or four, you might be killed yourself, and have to appear before the bar of God with three or four murders to answer for?”

“And a Milanese who understands his trade?”

“It is all the same; he would still be a simpleton. Do you know how my master expresses himself when he talks of me to his friends? Heaven has sent me this simpleton to carry on my business. If it were not for this simpleton I should never get on. It is the custom.”

“It is a silly custom, to say the least of it; and especially as it is we who have brought the art hither, and who carry it on. Is it possible that there is no remedy?”

“None. Time may accomplish it. The next generation may be different, but at present we must submit. And after all, what is it?”

“Why, if there is no other evil——”

“Ah! now that you are convinced, all will be well. Let us go to my master. Be of good courage.”

In fact, the promises of Bartolo were realised, and all was well. It was truly a kind Providence; for we shall see how little dependence Renzo could place on the treasure he had left at home,—the savings of his labour.
CHAPTER XVIII.

On this same day, the 13th of November, there arrived a courier extraordinary to the signor podestà of Lecco. The courier brought an express from the head of the police, containing an order to make every possible search for a young man of the name of Lorenzo Tramaglino, silk weaver, who, having escaped from the hands “of the illustrious head above cited,” had probably returned to the territory of Lecco. That, in case of his discovery, he should be committed to prison, and an account rendered to the police of his wicked practices, his ostensible means of procuring subsistence, and his accomplices. And furthermore, that an execution should be put into the house of the above-said Lorenzo Tramaglino, and every thing taken from thence that might aid in throwing light on his nefarious deeds.

The signor podestà, after ascertaining as well as he could, that Renzo had not returned to the village, took with him the constable of the place, and obeyed these injunctions, accompanied by a large escort of notary, constable, and officers. The key of the house was not to be found; the door was accordingly forced. The report of this transaction spread around, and soon reached the ears of Father Christopher. The good man was surprised and afflicted; and not being able to gain satisfactory information with regard to Renzo, he wrote to the Father Bonaventura for intelligence concerning him. In the mean while the relations and friends of Renzo were summoned to give in their testimony, with regard to his depravity of character. To bear the name of Tramaglino became a disgrace; the village was all in commotion. By little and little, it was understood that Renzo had escaped from the hands of justice, even in the heart of Milan, and had disappeared: it was whispered that he had committed some enormous crime, the nature of which remained unknown. The more enormous, however, the less it was believed, for Renzo was known by every body to be a worthy youth; the greatest number thought, therefore, that it was a machination of Don Roderick to ruin his poor rival. Thus it is true, that judging from inference, and without the indispensable knowledge of facts, we often wrongfully suspect even the wicked.

But we, who have the facts in our hands, can affirm, that if Don Roderick had no share in creating these misfortunes, he rejoiced in them as if they had been his own work; and made them a subject of merriment with his friends, and above all with Count Attilio, who had been deterred from prosecuting his intended journey to Milan by the account received of the disturbances there: but this order from the police gave him to understand that things had resumed their usual course. He then determined to depart immediately, and, exhorting his cousin to persist in his undertaking, and to surmount every obstacle, he promised to use his efforts to rid him of the friar. Attilio had hardly taken his departure, when Griso arrived, safe and sound, from Monza, and gave in his report to his master of all he had been able to collect. He told him that Lucy had been taken into the convent under the protection of the signora; that she lived there as secluded as if she were a nun, never putting her foot without the walls; that she assisted at the ceremonies of the church behind a grated window; and that it was impossible to obtain a view of her.

This relation put the devil into Roderick, or rather rendered the one more uncontrollable that sojourned there already. So many favourable circumstances concurring to forward his designs, inflamed the medley of spleen, rage, and infamous desire, which he dignified by the name of love. Renzo absent, expelled, banished, every measure against him became lawful; his betrothed herself might be considered in some sort as the property of a rebel. The only man who could and would take her under his protection, the friar, would soon be deprived of the power to do so; but, amidst so many unlooked-for facilities, one obstacle appeared to render them unavailable. A monastery of Monza, even if there were no signora there, was an obstacle not to be surmounted even by Don Roderick. He in vain wandered, in his imagination, around this asylum, not being able to devise any means of violating it, either by force or intrigue. He was upon the point of renouncing the enterprise, of going to Milan, of mixing in its pleasures, and thus drowning all remembrance of Lucy; but, in place of relief, would he not find there fresh food for vexation? Attilio had certainly told the story, and every one would ask him about the mountain girl! What reply would he be obliged to give? He had been outwitted by a capuchin and a clown; and, moreover, when a happy unexpected chance had rid him of the one, and a skilful friend removed the other, then he, like a simpleton, abandoned the undertaking! There was enough in this to prevent his ever lifting up his head in the society of his equals; or else to compel him to go among them sword in hand! And on the other hand, how could he return and remain in this spot, where he would be tormented by the remembrance of his passion, and the disgrace of its failure. How resolve? What do? Shall he go forward? Shall he draw back? A means presented itself to his mind, by which his enterprise might succeed. This was to call to his aid the assistance of a man whose power could accomplish whatever he thought fit to undertake, and for whom the difficulty of an enterprise would be only an additional motive for engaging in it. But this project had nevertheless its inconveniences and dangers, the consequences of which it was impossible to calculate. No one could foresee the termination of an affair, when they had once embarked in it with this man; a powerful auxiliary, assuredly, but a guide not less absolute than dangerous. Such reflections kept Don Roderick many days in a state of painful irresolution: he received, in the meanwhile, a letter from his cousin, informing him that the intrigue was prospering. After the lightning came the thunder. One fine morning he heard that Father Christopher had left the convent of Pescarenico! Such complete and prompt success, and the letter of Attilio, who encouraged him by his advice and vexed him by his jokes, inclined him to hazard every thing; and what above all confirmed him in his intention, was the unexpected intelligence that Agnes had returned to the village, and was at her own house! We will relate these two events for the information of the reader.

Lucy and her mother had hardly entered their asylum, when the news of the terrible insurrection at Milan spread through Monza, and even penetrated the walls of the convent. The accounts were various and contradictory.

The portress, who from necessity went much abroad, heard all the news, and related them to her guests. “They have put several in prison,” said she; “some were taken before the bakers of the Crutches, others in front of the house inhabited by the superintendant of provision——But listen to this; there was one who escaped, who was from Lecco, or thereabouts. I don't know his name, but I will ascertain it from some one; perhaps you may know him.”

This intelligence, joined to the circumstance that Renzo must have arrived in Milan precisely on this fatal day, gave some uneasiness to Lucy and her mother; judge what must have been their feelings, when the portress came again to tell them, “He that fled to avoid hanging is from your village, a silk weaver, one Tramaglino. Do you know him?”

Lucy was seated, busy at her work; it fell from her hands; she turned pale, and her emotion must certainly have attracted the attention of the portress, had she not been too eagerly engaged in delivering her report to Agnes, who was standing by the door at some distance from the poor girl. Agnes, notwithstanding she was much agitated, avoided any exhibition of her feelings. She made an effort to reply, that in a small village every one was known, but she could hardly believe this to be true of Tramaglino, as he was a quiet worthy youth. She asked if it was true that he had escaped, and if it was known where he was?

“Escaped, he certainly has, for every one knows it; but where, no one knows. Perhaps they may take him again, perhaps he is in safety; but if your peaceful youth falls into their hands——”

Here very fortunately the portress was called away; you may imagine the feelings of Agnes and her daughter! The poor woman and the desolate Lucy remained more than a day in cruel uncertainty, imagining the details and the probable consequences of this unhappy event. Tormented with vain hopes and anxious fears, their only relief was in each other's sympathy.

At length, a man arrived at the convent, and asked to see Agnes; he was a fishmonger of Pescarenico, who was going, according to custom, to Milan, to sell his fish; the good Christopher had desired him to stop at the convent, to relate what he knew of the unhappy affair of Renzo to Lucy and her mother, and exhort them, in his name, to have patience and to confide in God. As for him, he should certainly not forget them, and would seize every possible opportunity to aid them; in the meanwhile he would not fail to send them news every week, by this or some other means. All that the messenger could tell them further of Renzo was, that it was considered certain that he had taken refuge in Bergamo. Such a certainty was a great balm to the affliction of Lucy; her tears flowed less bitterly, and she experienced some comfort in discoursing upon it with her mother; and they united in heartfelt thanks to the Great Being who had saved them from so many dangers.

Gertrude made Lucy often visit her in her private parlour, and conversed much with her, finding a charm in the ingenuousness and sweetness of the poor girl, and delighted with listening to expressions of gratitude from her mouth. She changed insensibly the suspicions of Lucy with regard to her into a sentiment of the deepest compassion, by relating to her, in confidence, a part of her history, that part of it which she dared avow. Lucy found in the relation reasons more than sufficient to explain what had appeared strange in the manners of her benefactress. She was very careful, however, not to return the confidence Gertrude placed in her, by speaking of her new fears and misfortunes, lest she should thereby extend the knowledge of Renzo's supposed crime and disgrace. She avoided as much as possible replying to the repeated enquiries of the signora on that part of her history, which preceded the promise of marriage; to her modesty and innocence it appeared an impossible thing to converse freely on such a subject. Gertrude was often tempted to quarrel with her shyness, but how could she? Lucy was nevertheless so respectful, so grateful, so trusting! Sometimes her shrinking and susceptible modesty might displease her, from other motives; but all was lost in the sweetness of the thought that to Lucy, if to no other human being, she was doing good. And this was true; for besides the asylum she afforded her, her conversation and endearments encouraged the timid mind of the maiden; whose only other resource was constant employment. The nuns, at her solicitation, furnished her with occupation; and, as from morning till night she plied her needle, her reel, her beloved but now forsaken reel, recurred to her memory, bringing with it a throng of painful recollections.

The following week another message was received from Father Christopher, confirming the flight of Renzo, but with regard to the extent or nature of his misdemeanor, there was no further information. The friar had hoped for satisfaction on this point from his brother at Milan, to whom he had recommended him; but had received for answer that he had neither seen the young man, nor received the letter; that some one from abroad had been at the convent to ask for him, and not finding him there, had gone away.

The third week there was no messenger, which not only deprived them of a desired and expected consolation, but also produced a thousand uneasy suspicions. Before this, Agnes had thought of taking a journey home, and this disappointment confirmed her resolution. Lucy was unwilling to be separated from her mother, but her anxiety to gain more satisfactory intelligence of Renzo, and the security she felt in her sacred asylum, reconciled her. It was therefore agreed between them, that Agnes should wait on the road the following day for the return of the fishmonger from Milan, and should ask the favour of a seat in his cart, in order to go to her mountains. Upon seeing him approach, therefore, she asked him if Father Christopher had not sent any message by him. The fishmonger had been occupied the whole day before his departure in fishing, and had received no message from the friar! She then preferred her request, and having obtained a compliance with it, bade farewell to her daughter and the signora, promising a speedy return.

The journey was without accident; early in the morning they arrived at Pescarenico. Here Agnes took leave of her conductor, with many thanks for the obligation he had conferred on her; and as she was before the convent gates, she determined to speak with the good friar before she proceeded homeward. She pulled the bell—the friar Galdino, whom we may remember as the nut collector, appeared to answer it.

“Oh! good dame, what good wind brings you here?”

“I come to see Father Christopher!”

“Father Christopher? He is not here!”

“No? will it be long before he returns? Where is he gone?”

“To Rimini.”

“To——?”

“To Rimini.”

“Where is that?”

“Eh! eh! eh!” replied the friar, extending his arms, as if to indicate a great distance.

“Miserable that I am! But why did he go so suddenly?”

“Because the father provincial would have it so.”

“And why did they send away one who did so much good here? Oh! unhappy me!”

“If our superiors were obliged to give reasons for what they do, where would be our obedience, my good woman?”

“But this is such a loss!”

“Shall I tell you how it has happened? they have probably wanted a good preacher at Rimini; (we have them in every place to be sure, but sometimes a particular man is needed;) the father provincial of that place has written to the father provincial of this, to know if there were such a person in this convent; the father provincial returned for answer, that there was none but Father Christopher who corresponded to the description.”

“Oh! unfortunate! When did he go?”

“The day before yesterday.”

“Oh! if I had only come a few days sooner, as I wished to do! And do they not know when he will return?”

“Why! my dear woman! the father provincial knows, if any one does; but when one of our preachers has taken his flight, it is impossible to say on what branch he will rest. They want him here; they want him there; for we have convents in the four quarters of the world. Father Christopher will make a great noise at Rimini, with his Lent sermon; the fame of this great preacher will resound every where, and it is our duty to give him up, because we live on the charity of others, and it is but right we should serve all the world.”

“Oh! misery! misery!” cried Agnes, weeping; “what shall I do without this good man? He was a father to us; what a loss! what a loss!”

“Hear me, good woman—Father Christopher was truly a good man, but we have others equally so; there is Father Antanasio, Father Girolamo, Father Zaccaria! Father Zaccaria is a worthy man! And you must not wonder, as some ignorant people do, at his shrill voice and his little beard; I do not say that he is a preacher, because every one has his talent; but to give advice, he is the man.”

“Oh! holy patience!” cried Agnes, with a mixture of gratitude and vexation one feels at an offer containing more good-will than suitableness; “What is it to me what another man is, when he who is gone knew our affairs, and had every thing prepared to help us!”

“Then you must have patience.”

“I know that. Excuse the trouble I have given you.”

“That is of no consequence, my good woman; I pity you; if you decide upon asking advice of one of the fathers, you will find the convent still in its place. But let me see you soon, when I collect the oil.”

“God preserve you,” said Agnes; and she proceeded homeward, confused and disconcerted as a blind man who had lost his staff.

Having more information than Friar Galdino, we are enabled to relate the truth of this affair. Attilio, immediately on his arrival at Milan, performed his promise to Don Roderick, and visited his uncle of the secret council; (this was a committee composed of thirteen members, whose sanction was necessary to the proceedings of government; in case of the absence or death of the governor, the council assumed temporarily the control.) The count, one of the oldest members of the council, enjoyed in it some authority, which he did not fail to make known on all occasions. His language was ambiguous; his silence significant; he had the art of flattering, without absolutely promising; of menacing, without perhaps the power to perform; but these flatteries and menaces produced in the minds of others an impression of his unlimited power, which was the end and purpose of all his actions. Towards this point he lately made a great stride on an extraordinary occasion. He had been sent on an embassy to Madrid! And to hear him describe his reception there! Among other honours, the count-duke had treated him with particular attention, had admitted him to his confidence, so far as to ask him in the presence of the whole court, if he were pleased with Madrid? and to tell him on another occasion, at a window, that the cathedral of Milan was the most magnificent church in the king's dominions.

After having paid his duty to the count, and presented the compliments of his cousin, Attilio, with a seriousness which he knew well how to assume, said, “I believe it to be my duty to inform the signor, my uncle, of an affair in which Roderick is concerned, and which requires the interference of your lordship to avert the serious consequences that——”

“Ah! one of his pranks, I suppose.”

“In truth, I must say that the injury has not been committed by Roderick, but he is exasperated, and none but my uncle can——”

“What is it? what is it?”

“There is in his neighbourhood a capuchin friar who sets himself in array against my cousin, who hates him, and the matter stands thus——”

“How often have I told you both to let the friars manage their own affairs? It is enough for those to whom it belongs—but you, you can avoid having any thing to do with them——”

“Signor uncle, it is my duty to inform you that Roderick would have avoided it, if it had been possible. It is the friar who has quarrelled with him, and he has used every means——”

“What the devil can the friar have in common with my nephew?”

“First of all, he is known to be a quarrelsome fellow; he protects a peasant girl of the village, and regards her with a benevolence, to say the least of it, very suspicious.”

“I comprehend,” said his uncle; and a ray of malice passed over the depth of dulness which nature had stamped on his countenance.

“For some time,” continued Attilio, “the friar has suspected Roderick of designs on this young girl——”

“He has suspected, indeed! I know the signor Roderick too well myself, not to need to be told that he is incorrigible in such matters!”

“That Roderick, signor uncle, may have had some trifling conversation with this girl, I can very well believe; he is young, and, moreover, not a capuchin,—but these are idle tales, not worth engaging your attention. The serious part of the affair is, that the friar speaks of Roderick as if he were a villain, and instigates all the country against him——”

“And the other friars?”

“They do not meddle with it, because they know him to be hot-headed, though they have great respect for Roderick; but then, on the other hand, the friar passes for a saint with the villagers, and——”

“I imagine he does not know Roderick is my nephew.”

“Does he not know it? it is that, precisely, which animates him to this course of conduct.”

“How? how?”

“He takes pleasure, and he tells it to every one, he takes the more pleasure in vexing Roderick, because he has a protector as powerful as your lordship; he laughs at the nobility, and at diplomatists, and exults at the thought, that the girdle of Saint Francis can tie up all the swords, and that——”

“Oh! the presumptuous man! what is his name?”

“Friar Christopher, of ***,” said Attilio. The count drew his portfolio towards him, and inscribed the name.

Meanwhile, Attilio proceeded: “He has always had this character; his life is well known; he was a plebeian, and having some wealth, wished to associate with gentlemen, and not being able to succeed, killed one of them for rage; and to escape the gallows he assumed the habit of a friar.”

“Bravo! well done! we will see, we will see,” said the count in a fume.

“Now,” continued Attilio, “he is more enraged than ever, because he has failed in a project he had much at heart. It is by this that your lordship can see what kind of a man he is. He wished to have this girl married, to remove her from the dangers of the world, you understand; and he had found his man, a fellow whose name you have doubtless heard, because I have understood that the secret council has been obliged to take notice of the worthy youth.”

“Who is he?”

“A silk weaver, Lorenzo Tramaglino, he who——”

“Lorenzo Tramaglino!” cried the count. “Well done, friar! Truly—now I remember—he had a letter for a—it is a pity that—but no matter. And pray, why did Don Roderick say nothing of all this? why did he suffer things to go so far, before he acquainted one who has the power and the will to support him?”

“I will tell you also the truth with respect to that: knowing the multitude of cases which you have to perplex you, he has not been willing to add to them; and, besides, since I must say it, he is beside himself on account of the insults offered him by the friar, and would wish to wreak summary justice on him himself, rather than obtain it from prudence and the power of your lordship. I have tried to cool his ardour, but finding it impossible, I thought it my duty to inform your lordship, who, after all, is the prop and chief column of the house.”

“You ought to have spoken sooner.”

“That is true. But I hoped the affair would finish of itself, or that the friar would regain his reason, or that he would leave the convent, as often happens to these friars, who are sometimes here, sometimes there; and then all would have been settled. But——”

“The arrangement of the business now rests with me.”

“That is what I thought; I said to myself, the signor our uncle is the only one who can save the honour of Don Roderick; he has a thousand means that I know not of: I know that the father provincial has a great respect for him, and if our uncle should think that the best thing for this friar would be a change of air, he can in a few words——”

“Will your lordship leave the care of the business to him to whom it appertains?” said the count, sharply.

“Ah! that is true,” cried Attilio; “am I the man to give advice to your lordship? But the regard I have for the honour of the family made me speak. And I am afraid I have committed another folly,” added he, affecting a pensive air: “I am afraid I have injured Don Roderick in your opinion; I should have no rest if you doubted Roderick's confidence in you, and submission to your will. I hope the signor our uncle will believe, that in this case, it is truly——”

“Well, well, you two will be always friends, until one of you become prudent. Ever in fault, and relying on me to repair it! You give me more trouble than all the affairs of state!” continued he, with an expression of grave importance.

Attilio proffered a few more excuses, promises, and compliments, and took his leave, with a parting injunction from his uncle to be prudent!
CHAPTER XIX.

The signor count formed the resolution to make use of the father provincial to cut the knot of these perplexities; whether he would have thought of this, had it not been suggested by Attilio, it is impossible to determine, inasmuch as he would never have acknowledged this to be the case. It was important that one of his family, his nephew, should not be obliged to yield in an open controversy; it was a point essential to the reputation of his power, which he had so much at heart. The satisfaction which his nephew might himself take of his adversary would be a remedy worse than the disease. Should he order him to leave his castle, when obedience would seem like flying from the field of battle? Legal force could have no power over the capuchin; the clergy were entirely exempt from secular jurisdiction. All that he could attempt against such an adversary was to endeavour to have him removed and the power to do this rested with the father provincial.

Now the count and the father provincial were old acquaintances; they saw each other rarely, but always with great demonstrations of friendship, and reiterated offers of service.

When all was matured in his mind, the count invited the father provincial to a dinner, where he found a company of choice guests; noblemen, who, by their deportment, their native boldness, and lordly disdain, impressed those around them with the idea of their superiority and power. There were also present some clients, who, attached to the house by hereditary devotion, and the service of a life, sat at their lord's table, in a spirit of implicit submission, “devouring his discourse” and his dinner with unqualified and equal approbation.

At table, the count led the conversation to Madrid; he spoke of the court, the count-duke, the ministers, the family of the governor; of the bull-fights, which he could well describe, having seen them from a distinguished place; of the escurial, of which he could speak in its most minute details, because a page of the count-duke had conducted him into every nook of it. For some time all the company were attentive to him alone; then they divided into separate parties. He continued for a while to relate a number of anecdotes, as in confidence, to the father provincial, who was seated near him. But suddenly he gave a turn to the conversation, and spoke of Cardinal Barberini, who was a capuchin, and brother to the reigning pope, Urban VIII. As they left the table, the count invited the father provincial to go with him into another apartment.

The noble lord gave a seat to the reverend father, and taking one himself, said, “Considering the friendship that exists between us, I thought I was authorised to speak to your reverence of an affair equally interesting to us both, and which had best be concluded between us without going farther, which might—and I will tell you frankly what it is, as I am certain we shall have the same opinion on the subject. Tell me, in your convent of Pescarenico, is there not a Father Christopher of ***?”

The father provincial bowed assent.

“I pray your reverence to tell me, frankly, as a friend,—this man—this father—I have no personal acquaintance with him, 'tis true; I know many fervent, prudent, humble capuchins, who are worth their weight in gold; I have been the friend of the order from infancy; but in a numerous family there is always some individual—— And I have reason to think that Friar Christopher is a man—a little fond of quarrelling—who has not all the prudence he might have: I imagine he has caused your reverence much anxiety.”

“I perceive there is some intrigue,” thought the father provincial; “it is my fault; I knew that this holy man should have been sent from pulpit to pulpit, and not have been suffered to remain six months in a convent in the country.—Oh,” said he, aloud, “I am truly sorry that your excellency has conceived such an opinion of Father Christopher; for I know that his conduct in the convent is exemplary, and that he is esteemed by every body.”

“I understand very well; your reverence ought—— However, I would as a friend inform you of a matter which it is necessary you should know. This Father Christopher has taken under his protection a young man of that country, one of whom your reverence must have heard; him who recently escaped from the hands of justice, on the terrible day of San Martin—Lorenzo Tramaglino!”

“I had not heard of this,” said the father provincial; “but your excellency knows that it is the duty of our order to seek those who have gone astray, for the purpose of leading them back.”

“That is true; but I thought it best to give you this information, because, if ever his holiness—the intelligence of it may have been sent to Rome.”

“I am much obliged to your excellency for the information. However, I am certain, that if the affair is enquired into, it will be found that Father Christopher has had no connection with this man but for the purpose of doing him good. I know the father well.”

“Your reverence knows, then, better than I, what he was in the world, and the pranks of his youth.”

“It is the glory of our habit, signor count, that whatever a man may have been in the world, once clothed with that, he is quite another person; and since the Father Christopher has belonged to our order——”

“I believe it from the bottom of my heart, I believe it; but sometimes—as the proverb says—The habit does not make the monk.”

The proverb was not much to the purpose, but the count had cited it, in place of another which occurred to him,—“The wolf may change his skin, but he does not become a dog.”

“I have certain information,” pursued he.

“If your excellency knows positively that the father has committed a fault (we are all liable to err), I wish you would inform me of it. I am his superior—unworthily, 'tis true; but it is my duty to watch over, and, if necessary, correct——”

“Besides the circumstance of his granting protection to the man I have mentioned, this same Father Christopher has undertaken to contend—but we can settle it together with my nephew, Don Roderick.”

“Oh, I am sorry for that, I am sorry for that, truly.”

“My nephew is young, rash, and not accustomed to provocation.”

“It becomes my duty to obtain the best information on the subject. Your excellency, with your experience of the world, knows better than I, that we are all frail, liable to error—some one way, some another; and if our Father Christopher has failed——”

“But these are things which had better be settled between ourselves; to spread them abroad would only increase the evil. These trifles are often the cause of numerous embarrassments and difficulties, which might have been prevented by some decisive act in the commencement. That is now our business; my nephew is young; the monk, from what I hear, has still the spirit, the inclinations of a young man; but we, who are advanced in years, (too true, is it not, reverend father?) must have prudence to act for the young, and apply a remedy to their follies. Happily there is yet time; we must remove the fire from the straw. An individual who does not do well in one place may in another; your reverence might see to his being removed, might find a suitable station for the friar at a sufficient distance—all may be easily arranged—or rather, there's no harm done.”

The father provincial had expected this conclusion from the commencement of the conversation. “I perceive,” thought he, “where you would lead me; when a poor friar gives one of you the least umbrage, the superior must make him march, right or wrong.”

When the count had finished, the provincial said aloud, “I understand what the signor count would say; but before taking a step——”

“It is a step, and it is not a step, very reverend father: it is only a natural event, such as might happen in the ordinary course of affairs; and if we do not do it quickly, I foresee a deluge of disorders, a mountain of grievances. If we do not put a stop to the affair between ourselves, it is not possible it should remain a secret. And then it is not only my nephew—you raise a wasp's nest, very reverend father. We are a powerful house—we have adherents.”

The father bowed in assent. The count proceeded. “You understand me; they are all people who have blood in their veins, and who in the world—count as something. They are proud of their honour; the affair will become theirs, and then——  Even those who are the friends of peace——  It would be a grief of heart to me to be obliged——  I, who have always had such a friendship for the capuchins! The fathers, for their ministry to be efficient, should be in harmony with all men—no misunderstandings: besides, they have relations abroad—and these affairs of punctilio extend, ramify——  I, too, have a certain dignity to maintain——  His excellency—— my noble colleagues——  It becomes a party matter——”

“It is true,” said the provincial, “that Father Christopher is a preacher; I had already the intention—I have even been solicited to do it—but under these circumstances, and just at this time, it might be considered as a punishment; and to punish without being well acquainted——”

“But it is not a punishment; it is a prudent precaution, an honest means of preventing evils that might—— I have explained myself.”

“The signor count and myself understand each other very well; but the facts being those which your excellency has adduced, it is impossible but that they should in part be known through the country: there are every where firebrands, or idle spirits, who find pleasure in the contests of the monks and the nobility, and love to make malignant observations. Each one has his own dignity to preserve; and I, in the character of a superior, have an express duty—the honour of the habit—it is not my own affair—it is a deposit which—and since the signor your nephew is so irritated, as your excellency has said, he might take it as a satisfaction offered to him, and—I do not say boast of it, but——”

“You jest, reverend father, surely; my nephew is a cavalier of consideration in the world, as he should be; but in his relations with me, he is but a child, and will do neither more nor less than I prescribe to him. And, moreover, he shall never know it. The thing is done between ourselves; there is no necessity for rendering an account to him. Let not that give you any uneasiness; I am accustomed to keep silence on important subjects. As to the idle talk of others, what can be said? It is a very common thing to see a friar leave one place to go and preach at another.”

“However, in order to prevent malicious observations, it would be necessary, on this occasion, that the nephew of your excellency should give some demonstration of friendship, of deference,—not for us, but for the order.”

“Certainly, certainly, that is but right; it is not necessary, however; I know that the capuchins are highly esteemed by my nephew, as well as by our whole family. But, in this case, something more signal is very proper. Leave it to me, very reverend father: I will give such orders to my nephew—that is to say, it shall be prudently suggested to him, that he may not suspect what has passed between us, because we need not apply a plaster where there is no wound. As to that which we have agreed on, the sooner it is done the better; and if you had a place at some distance—to remove every occasion——”

“They want a preacher at Rimini; and perhaps without this motive I should have thought——”

“That is very opportune, very opportune. And when?”

“Since the thing is to be done, it shall be quickly.”

“Certainly, certainly; better to-day than to-morrow. And,” continued he, rising, “if I or my adherents can render any service to the good father capuchins——”

“We have often experienced the kindness of the house,” said the father provincial, also rising, and following his vanquisher to the door of the apartment.

“We have extinguished a spark,” said the count,—“a spark, very reverend father, which might have excited a great conflagration. Between good friends, things are easily arranged.”

They then entered the next apartment, and mixed with the rest of the company.

The count obtained his end: Friar Christopher was made to travel on foot from Pescarenico to Rimini, as we shall see.

One evening a capuchin from Milan arrived at Pescarenico, with a packet for the superior: it was an order for Father Christopher to repair to Rimini for the purpose of preaching the Lent sermons. The letter contained instructions to the superior, to insinuate to the friar, that he should give up every attention to any business he might have on hand in the country he must leave, and that he should not maintain any correspondence there. The friar, who was the bearer of the order, was to be the companion of his journey. The superior said nothing that night, but in the morning he sent for Father Christopher, showed him the order, and told him to take his basket, staff, and girdle, and with the friar, whom he presented to him, commence his journey.

Imagine what a blow this was for our good father. Renzo, Lucy, Agnes, passed rapidly over his mind, and he thought, “Great God! what will these unfortunate people do, when I am no longer here?” but raising his eyes to heaven, he placed his hope and confidence there. He crossed his hands on his breast, and bowed his head in token of obedience; he then went to his cell, took his basket, his staff, and his breviary, and after having bid farewell to his brethren, and obtained the benediction of his superior, took, with his companion, the route prescribed.

We have said that Don Roderick, more than ever determined on the accomplishment of his infamous enterprise, had resolved to seek the assistance of a powerful man. We cannot give his name, nor even hazard a conjecture with regard to it; this is the more astonishing, inasmuch as we find notices of this personage in several histories of the time. The identity of the facts does not leave a doubt of the identity of the man; but there is evidently an extreme care to avoid the mention of his name. Francesco Rivola, in his life of the Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, speaking of him, says, “He was a lord as powerful from his wealth as illustrious from his birth,” and nothing further. Giuseppe Ripamonti makes farther mention of him, as a man, this man, a person, this person. “I will relate,” says he, “the case of a man, who, belonging to the most powerful family in the city, chose the country for his residence; and there, assuring himself of impunity by the force of crime, he set at nought the law and the magistrates, the king and the nobles. Placed on the extreme confines of the state, he led an independent life; he offered an asylum to the outlaw; he was outlawed himself, and then absolved from the sentence which had led——” We will hereafter quote from this author other passages, which will confirm the history we are about to relate.

To do that which was forbidden by the laws; to be the arbiter, the supreme judge in the affairs of others, without other interest than a thirst for power; to be feared by all, even by those who were the objects of fear to all men; these had ever been the controlling principles which actuated the conduct of this man. From his youth he had been filled with impatient envy at the power and authority of others; superior to the greater number in riches and retinue, and to all perhaps in birth and audacity, he constrained them to renounce all competition with him; he took some into his friendship, but was far from admitting any equality between himself and them; his proud and disdainful spirit could only be content with those who were willing to acknowledge their inferiority, and to yield to him on all occasions. When, however, they found themselves in any difficulty, they did not fail to solicit the aid of so powerful an auxiliary; and a refusal from him would have been the destruction of his reputation, and of the high station which he had assumed. So that, for himself and others, he had performed such deeds that not all his own power and that of his family could prevent his banishment and outlawry; and he was obliged to leave the state. I believe that it is to this circumstance Ripamonti alludes:—

“He was obliged to leave the country: but his audacity was unsubdued; he went through the city on horseback, followed by a pack of hounds, and with the sound of the trumpet; passing by the court of the palace, he sent an abusive message to the governor by one of the guards.”

In his absence he did not desist from his evil practices; he maintained a correspondence with his friends, “who were united to him,” says Ripamonti, “in a secret league of atrocious deeds.”

It appears that he even contracted new habits, of which the same historian speaks with mysterious brevity. “Foreign princes had recourse to him for important murders, and they even sent him reinforcements of soldiers to act under his orders.”

At last, whether the proclamation of his outlawry was withdrawn from some powerful intercession, or that the audacity of the man outweighed all authority, he resolved to return home; not exactly to Milan, but to a castle on the frontier of the Bergamascan territory, which then belonged to the Venetian state. “This house,” says Ripamonti, “was a focus of sanguinary mandates. The household was composed of such as had been guilty of great crimes; the cooks, and the scullions even, were not free from the stain of murder.” Besides this notable household, he had men resembling them, stationed in different places of the two states, on the confines of which he lived.

All, however tyrannical themselves, had been obliged to choose between the friendship or enmity of this tyrannical man, and it fared ill with those who dared resist him. It was in vain to hope to preserve neutrality or independence; his orders to do such or such a thing, or to refrain, were arbitrary, and resistance was useless. Recourse was had to him on all occasions, and by all sorts of people, good as well as bad, for the arrangements of their difficulties; so that he occasionally became the protector of the oppressed, who could not have obtained redress in any other way, public or private. He was almost always the minister of wickedness, revenge, and caprice; but the various ways in which he had employed his power impressed upon all minds a great idea of his capability to devise and perform his acts in defiance of every obstruction, whether lawful or unlawful. The fame of ordinary tyrants was confined to their own districts, and every district had its tyrant; but the fame of this extraordinary man was spread throughout the Milanese; his life was the subject of popular tales, and his name carried with it something powerful and mysterious. Every tyrant was suspected of alliance with him, every assassin of acting under his orders; at every extraordinary crime, of the author of which they were ignorant, the name of this man was uttered, whom, thanks to the circumspection of our historians, we are obliged to call the Unknown.

The distance between his castle and that of Don Roderick was not more than six miles. The latter had long felt the necessity of keeping on good terms with such a neighbour, and had proffered his services, and entitled himself to the same sort of friendship, as the rest; he was however, careful to conceal the nature and strictness of the union between them. Don Roderick liked to play the tyrant, but not openly; tyranny was with him a means, not an end; he wished to live at ease in the city, and enjoy the advantages, pleasures, and honours of civilised life. To insure this, he was obliged to exhibit management, to testify a great esteem for his relations, to cultivate the friendship of persons in place, in order to sway the balance of justice for his own peculiar purposes. Now, an intimacy with such a man would not have advanced his interests in such points, and especially with his uncle; but a slight acquaintance with him might be considered unavoidable under the circumstances, and therefore in some degree excusable. One morning Don Roderick, equipped for the chase, with an escort of retainers, among whom was Griso, took the road to the castle of the Unknown.
CHAPTER XX.

The castle of the Unknown was situated above a narrow and shady valley, on the summit of a cliff, which, belonging to a rugged chain of mountains, was nevertheless separated from them by banks, caverns, and precipices. It was only accessible on the side which overlooked the valley. This was a declivity rather steep, but equal, and continued towards the summit: it was occupied as pasture ground, and its lower borders were cultivated, having habitations scattered here and there. The bottom was a bed of stones, through which flowed, according to the season, a small brook, or a large torrent, which served for a boundary between the two territories. The opposite chain of mountains, which formed, as it were, the other wall of the valley, was slightly cultivated towards its base; the rest was composed of precipitous rocks without verdure, and thrown together irregularly and wildly. The scene altogether was one of savage grandeur.

From this castle, as the eagle from his eyrie, its lawless owner overlooked his domain, and heard no human sound above him. He could embrace at a view all the environs, the declivities, the abyss, the practicable approaches. To the eyes of one viewing it from above, the winding path which ascended towards the terrible habitation could be perceived throughout its whole course, and from the windows and loopholes, the signor could leisurely count the steps of the person ascending, and examine him with the closest scrutiny. With the garrison of bravoes which he kept at the castle he could defy an army, which he would have crushed in the valley beneath, before an individual could reach the summit. But none, except such as were friends with the master of the castle, dared set foot even in the valley. Tragical stories were related of some who had attempted the dangerous enterprise, but these stories were already of times long past, and none of the young vassals could remember to have encountered a human being in this place, except under his lord's authority.

Don Roderick arrived in the middle of the valley, at the foot of the cliff, at the commencement of the rugged and winding path; at this point was a tavern, which might have been called a guard-house; an old sign, with a rising sun painted on both sides, was suspended before the door; but the people gave the place the more appropriate name of Malanotte.

At the noise of the approaching cavalcade a young boy, well furnished with swords and pistols, appeared on the threshold of the door; and casting a rapid glance at the party, informed three ruffians, who were playing at cards within the house, of its approach. He who appeared to be the chief among them arose, and recognising a friend of his master, saluted him respectfully; Don Roderick returned the salutation with much politeness, and asked if the signor was at the castle. The man replied in the affirmative; and he, dismounting, threw his horse's bridle to Aimwell, one of his retinue. Then, taking his musket from his shoulder, he gave it to Montanarolo, as if to relieve himself from an useless encumbrance, but in reality because he knew that on this cliff none were permitted to bear arms. Drawing from his pocket some berlinghe, he gave them to Tanabuso, saying, “Wait here till my return; and in the mean time amuse yourselves with these honest people.” Then presenting to the chief of the band some crowns of gold for himself and his companions, he ascended the path with Griso.

Another bravo belonging to the Unknown, who was on his way to the castle, bore him company; thus sparing him the trouble of declaring his name to whomsoever he should meet. When he arrived at the castle (Griso was left at the gate) he was conducted through a long succession of dark galleries, and various halls hung with muskets, sabres, and other weapons of warfare; each of these halls was guarded by a bravo. After having waited some time, he was admitted to the presence of the Unknown, who advanced to meet him, replying to his salutation, and at the same time, as was his custom, even with his oldest friends, eying him from head to foot. He was tall in stature; and from the baldness of his head, and the deep furrows of his countenance, appeared to be much older than sixty, which was his real age; his countenance and movements, the firmness of his features, and the fire which sparkled from his eyes, indicated a vigour of body as well as of mind which would have been remarkable even in a young man.

Don Roderick told him he had come for advice and assistance; that, having embarked in a difficult enterprise, from which his honour did not suffer him to withdraw, he had remembered the promises of one who never promised in vain; and he then related his abominable intrigue. The Unknown, who had already heard something of it, listened with much attention to the recital, both because he naturally loved such relations, and because Friar Christopher, that avowed enemy of tyrants, was concerned in it. Don Roderick spoke of the difficulty of the undertaking, the distance of the place, a monastery, the signora,—but the Unknown, as if prompted by the demon in his heart, interrupted him, saying, that he took the charge of the affair on himself. He wrote down the name of the poor Lucy, and dismissed Don Roderick, saying, “In a little while you will receive news from me.”

The reader may remember the villain Egidio, who lived near the walls of the monastery into which Lucy had been received; now, he was one of the most intimate colleagues in crime of the Unknown; and this accounts for the promptness with which this lord assumed the charge of the undertaking. However, no sooner was he left alone than he repented of his precipitation. He had for some time experienced, not remorse, but a vague uneasiness on account of his crimes; at every new addition to them, the remembrance of those he had previously committed pressed upon his memory, if not upon his conscience, and loaded it with an intolerable weight. An undefinable repugnance to the commission of crime, such as he had experienced and subdued at the outset of his career, returned with all its force to overwhelm his spirit. The thoughts of the future contributed to render the past more painful. “To grow old! to die! and then?” And the image of death, which he had so often met undaunted, in face of an enemy, and which seemed to inflame his courage and double his energy—this same image now, in the midnight silence of his castle, quelled his spirit, and impressed him with an awe which he in vain endeavoured to resist. Formerly, the frequent spectacle of violence and murder, inspiring him with a ferocious emulation, had served as a kind of authority against his conscience; now the confused but terrible idea arose in his mind of individual responsibility at the bar of God. The idea of having risen above the crowd of vulgar criminals, and of having left them far behind, an idea which once flattered his pride, now impressed him with a sentiment of fearful solitude; and experiencing at certain moments of despondence the power and presence of that God whose existence he had hitherto neither admitted nor denied, having been wholly immersed in himself, his accumulated crimes rose up, to justify the sentence which was about to condemn him to eternal banishment from the divine presence. But this uneasiness was not suffered to appear, either in his words or his actions; he carefully concealed it under the appearance of more profound and intense ferocity. Regretting the time when he was accustomed to commit iniquity without remorse, without any other solicitude than for its success, he made every effort to recall these habits and feelings; to take pleasure in wickedness; and glory in his shame, in order to convince himself that he was still the same man.

This accounts for the promptitude of his promise to Don Roderick: he wished to deprive himself of the chance of hesitation; but, scarcely alone, he felt his resolution fail, and thoughts arose in his mind which almost tempted him to break his word, and expose his weakness to an inferior accomplice. But with a violent effort he put an end to the painful conflict. He sent for Nibbio[30], one of the most skilful and resolute ministers of his atrocities, and of whom he had made use in his correspondence with Egidio, and ordered him to mount his horse, to go to Monza, to inform Egidio of the affair he had undertaken, and to require his assistance for its accomplishment.

The messenger returned sooner than his master expected him with the reply of Egidio; the enterprise was easy and safe; the Unknown had only to send a carriage with two or three bravoes, well disguised; Egidio took charge of the rest. The Unknown, whatever passed in his mind, gave orders to Nibbio to arrange every thing, and to set out immediately on the expedition.

If, to perform the horrible service which had been required of him, Egidio had depended only on his ordinary means, he would not certainly have sent back so explicit an answer. But in the asylum of the convent, where every thing appeared as an obstacle, the villain had a means known to himself alone; and that which would have been an insurmountable difficulty to others was to him an instrument of success. We have related how the unhappy signora once lent an ear to his discourse, and the reader may have surmised that this was not the last time; it was only the first step in the path of abomination and blood. The same voice which then addressed her, become imperious through crime, now imposed on her the sacrifice of the innocent girl who had been intrusted to her care.

The proposition appeared frightful to Gertrude; to lose Lucy in any manner would have seemed to her a misfortune, a punishment; and to deprive herself of her with criminal perfidy, to add to her crimes by dealing treacherously with the confiding girl, was to take away the only gleam of virtuous enjoyment which had shone upon her mysterious and wicked career. She tried every method to avoid obedience; every method, except the only infallible one, that was in her power. Crime is a severe and inflexible master, against whom we are strong only when we entirely rebel. Gertrude could not resolve on that, and obeyed.

The day agreed on came; the hour approached; Gertrude, alone with Lucy, bestowed on her more caresses than ordinary, which the poor girl returned with increasing tenderness, as the lamb licks the hand of the shepherd who entices it without the fold into the murderous power of the butcher who there awaits it.

“I want you to do me a great favour; many are ready to obey me, but there is none but yourself whom I can trust. I must speak immediately on an affair of great importance, which I will relate to you some other time, to the superior of the capuchins, who brought you hither, my dear Lucy; but no one must know that I have sent for him. I rely on you to carry a secret message——”

Lucy was astonished at such a request, and alleged her reasons for declining to perform it; without her mother! without a companion! in a solitary road! in a strange country! But Gertrude, instructed in an infernal school, showed great astonishment and displeasure at her refusal, after having been loaded with so many benefits; she affected to treat her excuses as frivolous. “In open day! a short distance! a road that Lucy had travelled a few days before!” She said so much, that the poor girl, touched with gratitude and shame, enquired, “What was to be done?”

“Go to the convent of the capuchins; ask for the superior, tell him to come here immediately, but to let no one suspect that he comes at my request.”

“But what shall I say to the portress, who has never seen me go out, and will ask me where I am going?”

“Endeavour to pass without being seen; and if you cannot, say you are going to some church to perform your orisons.”

A new difficulty for Lucy! to tell a falsehood! but the signora was so offended at her refusal, and so ridiculed her for preferring a vain scruple to her gratitude, that the unhappy girl, alarmed rather than convinced, replied, “Well, I will go; may God be my guide and protector.”

Gertrude, from her grated window, followed her with anxious looks, and when she saw her about to cross the threshold, overcome by irresistible emotion, she cried, “Stop, Lucy.”

Lucy returned to the window; but another idea, the one accustomed to predominate, had resumed its sway over the mind of the unhappy Gertrude. She affected dissatisfaction at the directions she had given; described the road again to Lucy, and dismissed her: “Do exactly as I have told you, and return quickly.”

Lucy passed the door of the cloister unobserved, and proceeding on her way with downcast eyes, found, with the aid of the directions given, and her own recollections, the gate of the suburb; timid and trembling, she continued on the high road, until she arrived at that which led to the convent. This road was buried, like the bed of a river, between two high banks, bordered with trees, whose branches united to form an arch above it. On finding it entirely deserted, she felt her fears revive; she hurried on, but gained courage from the sight of a travelling carriage which had stopped a short distance before her; before the door of it, which was open, there stood two travellers looking about, as if uncertain of their way. As she approached, she heard one of them say, “Here is a good girl, who will tell us the way.” As she came on a line with the carriage, this same man addressed her: “My good girl, can you tell us the way to Monza?”

“You are going in the wrong direction,” replied the poor girl; “Monza lies there.” As she turned to point it out, his companion (it was Nibbio) seized her by the waist, and lifted her from the ground. Lucy screamed from surprise and terror; the ruffian threw her into the carriage; a third, who was seated in the bottom of it, seized her, and compelled her to sit down before him; another put a handkerchief over her mouth, and stifled her cries. Nibbio then entered the carriage, the door was closed, and the horses set off on a gallop. He who had asked her the perfidious question remained behind; he was an emissary of Egidio, who had watched Lucy when she quitted the convent, and had hastened by a shorter road to inform his colleagues, and wait for her at the place agreed on.

But who can describe the terror and anguish of the unfortunate girl? Who can tell what passed in her heart? Cruelly anxious to ascertain her horrible situation, she wildly opened her eyes, but closed them again at the sight of those frightful faces. She struggled in vain. The men held her down in the bottom of the carriage: if she attempted to cry, they drew the handkerchief tightly over her mouth. In the mean while, three gruff voices, endeavouring to assume a tone of humanity, said to her, “Be quiet, be quiet: do not be afraid; we do not wish to harm you.” After a while her struggles ceased, she languidly opened her eyes, and the horrible faces before her appeared to blend themselves into one monstrous image; her colour fled, and she fell lifeless into their arms.

“Courage, courage,” said Nibbio; but Lucy was now beyond the reach of his horrible voice.

“The devil! she appears to be dead,” said one of them. “If she should really be dead!”

“Poh!” said the other, “these fainting fits are common to women; they don't die in this way.”

“Hush,” said Nibbio, “be attentive to your duty, and do not meddle with other affairs. Keep your muskets ready, because this wood we are entering is a nest for robbers. Don't keep them in your hands—the devil! put them behind you. Do you not see that this girl is a tender chicken, who faints at nothing? If she sees that you have arms, she may die in reality. When she comes to her senses, be careful not to frighten her. Touch her not, unless I tell you to do so. I can hold her. Keep quiet, and let me talk to her.”

Meanwhile the carriage entered the wood. Poor Lucy awoke as from a profound and painful slumber. She opened her eyes, and her horrible situation rushed with full force upon her mind. She struggled again in vain, she attempted to scream, but Nibbio said to her, holding up the handkerchief, “Be tranquil; it is the best thing you can do. We do not wish to harm you; but if you do not keep silence, we must make you.”

“Let me go. Who are you? Where are you taking me? Why am I here? Let me go, let me go.”

“I tell you, don't be frightened. You are not a child, and you ought to know that we will not harm you. We might have murdered you before this, if such had been our intention. Be quiet, then.”

“No, no, let me go; I know you not.”

“We know you well enough, however.”

“Oh, holy Virgin! Let me go, for charity's sake. Who are you? Why have you brought me here?”

“Because we have been ordered to do so.”

“Who? who? who ordered you to do it?”

“Hush!” said Nibbio, in a severe tone. “Such questions must not be answered.”

Lucy attempted to throw herself from the door of the carriage, but finding the effort vain, she had recourse again to entreaties, and with her cheeks bathed in tears, and her voice broken by sobs, she continued, “Oh, for the love of heaven, and the holy Virgin, let me go! What harm have I done you? I am a poor creature, who have never injured you; I forgive you all that you have done, and will pray to God for you. If you have a daughter, a wife, or a mother, think what they would suffer in my situation. Remember that we must all die, and that one day you will hope that God will show mercy to you. Let me go, let me go; the Lord will guide me on my way.”

“We cannot.”

“You cannot? Great God! why can you not? Where are you taking me?”

“We cannot; your supplications are useless. Do not be frightened; we will not harm you. Be quiet; no one shall harm you.”

More than ever alarmed to perceive that her words produced no effect, Lucy turned to Him who holds in his powerful hand the hearts of men, and can, if he sees fit, soften the most ferocious. She crossed her arms on her breast, and prayed from the depth of her heart, fervently; then again vainly implored to be set free: but we have not the heart to relate more at length this painful journey, which lasted four hours, and which was to be succeeded by many hours of still deeper anguish.

At the castle, the Unknown was waiting her arrival with extraordinary solicitude and agitation of mind. Strange, that he who had coldly and calmly disposed of so many lives, and had regarded as nothing the torments he inflicted, should now feel an impression of remorse, almost of terror, at the tyranny he exercised over an unknown girl, an humble peasant! From a high window of his castle, he had for some time looked down upon the valley beneath; at last he saw the carriage approaching slowly at a distance, as if the horses were wearied with their rapid journey. He perceived it, and felt his heart beat violently.

“Is she there?” thought he. “What trouble this girl gives me! I must free myself from it.” And he prepared himself to send one of his ruffians to meet the carriage, and tell Nibbio to conduct the girl immediately to the castle of Don Roderick; but an imperious No, which made itself heard by his conscience, caused him to relinquish his design. Tormented, however, by the necessity of ordering something to be done, and insupportably weary of waiting the slow approach of the carriage, he sent for an old woman who was attached to his service.

This woman had been born in the castle, and had passed her life in it. She had been impressed from infancy with an opinion of the unlimited power of its masters; and her principal maxim was implicit obedience towards them. To the ideas of duty were united sentiments of respect, fear, and servile devotion. When the Unknown became lord of the castle, and began to make such horrible use of his power, she experienced a degree of pain, and at the same time a more profound sentiment of subjection. In time she became habituated to what was daily acting before her: the powerful and unbridled will of such a lord she viewed as an exercise of fated justice. When somewhat advanced in years, she had espoused a servant of the house, who being sent on a hazardous expedition, left his body on the high road, and his wife a widow in the castle. The revenge that her lord took for his death imparted to her a savage consolation, and increased her pride at being under his protection. From that day she rarely set foot beyond the castle walls, and by degrees there remained to her no other idea of human beings, than that of those by whom she was daily surrounded. She was not employed in any particular service, but each one gave her something to do as it pleased him. She had sometimes clothes to mend, food to prepare, and wounds to dress. Commands, reproaches, and thanks were equally mingled with abusive raillery: she went by the appellation of the old woman, and the tone with which the name was uttered varied according to the circumstances and humour of the speaker. Disturbed in her idleness and irritated in her self-love, which were her two ruling passions, she returned these compliments with language in which Satan might have recognised more of his own genius than in that of her persecutors.

“You see that carriage below there,” said the Unknown.

“I do,” said she.

“Have a litter prepared immediately, and let it carry you to Malanotte. Quick, quick; you must arrive before the carriage; it approaches with the slow step of death. In this carriage there is—there ought to be—a young girl. If she is there, tell Nibbio from me, that he must place her in the litter, and that he must come at once to me. You will get into the litter with her; and when you arrive here, you must take her to your room. If she asks you where you are leading her, whose is this castle, be careful——”

“Oh, do not doubt me,” said the old woman.

“But,” pursued the Unknown, “comfort her, encourage her.”

“What can I say to her?”

“What can you say to her? Comfort her, I tell you. Have you arrived at this age, and know not how to administer consolation to the afflicted? Have you never had any sorrow? Have you never been visited by fear? Do you not know the language that consoles in such moments? Speak this language to her then; find it in the remembrance of your own misfortunes. Go directly.”

When she was gone, he remained some time at the window, gazing at the approaching carriage; he then looked at the setting sun, and the glorious display of clouds about the horizon. He soon withdrew, closed the window, and kept pacing the apartment in a state of uneasy excitement.
CHAPTER XXI.

The old woman hastened to obey, and gave orders, under authority of that name which, by whomsoever pronounced, set the whole castle in motion, as no one imagined that any one would dare to use it unauthorised. She reached Malanotte a little before the carriage: when it was near at hand, she left the litter; and making a sign to the coachman to stop, approached the window, and whispered in the ear of Nibbio the will of her master.

Lucy, sensible that the motion of the carriage had ceased, shook off the lethargy into which she had for some time been plunged, and in an agony of terror looked around her. Nibbio had drawn himself back on the seat, and the old woman, resting her chin on the window, said to Lucy, “Come, my child; come, poor girl; come with me. I have orders to treat you kindly, and to offer you every consolation.”

At the sound of a female voice the unfortunate girl felt a momentary relief, which was, however, succeeded by deeper terror as she looked at the person from whom it proceeded. “Who are you?” said she, anxiously fixing her eyes upon her.

“Come, come, poor girl,” repeated the old woman.

Nibbio and his two companions, inferring the designs of their master from the extraordinary deportment of the old woman, endeavoured to persuade the poor girl to obey; but Lucy kept gazing at the wild and savage solitude around, which left her no ray of hope. However, she attempted to cry out; but seeing Nibbio give a look to the handkerchief, she stopped, trembled, was seized, and then placed in the litter. The old woman was placed beside her; and Nibbio left the two villains for their escort, and hastened forward at the call of his master. Lucy, aroused to momentary energy by the near approach of the deformed and withered features of her companion, cried, “Where am I? Where are you taking me?”

“To one who wishes you well; to a great—you are a lucky girl; be happy, do not be afraid; be happy. He has told me to encourage you; you will tell him that I have done so, will you not?”

“Who is this man? What is he? What does he want with me? I do not belong to him. Tell me where I am. Let me go. Tell these men to let me go, to take me to some church. Oh, you, who are a woman, in the name of the holy Virgin, I entreat you.”

This holy and tender name, so often pronounced with respect in her early years, and for so long a time neglected and forgotten, produced on the mind of the wretched woman, who had not heard it for so long a time, a confused impression, like the remembrance of lights and shadows on the mind of one blind from infancy.

Meanwhile the Unknown, standing at the door of the castle, looked below, and saw the litter slowly ascending, and Nibbio walking a few steps in advance of it. At the sight of his master, he hurried forward. “Come here,” said the signor to him, and led the way to an inner hall. “Well?” said he, stopping.—“All has been done according to your wishes,” replied Nibbio, bowing. “The order in time, the young girl in time, no one near the place, a single cry, no one alarmed, the coachman diligent, the horses swift; but——”

“But what?”

“But, to say truth, I would rather have received orders to plunge a dagger in her heart at once, than to have been obliged to look at her, and hear her entreaties.”

“What is this? What is this? What do you mean?”

“I would say that during the whole journey—yes, during the whole journey—she has excited my compassion.”

“Compassion! What dost thou know of compassion? What is compassion?”

“I have never understood what it is until to-day; it is something like fear; if it takes possession of one, one is no longer a man.”

“Let me hear, then, what she has done to excite your compassion?”

“Oh, most illustrious signor, she wept, implored, and looked so piteously; then turned pale, pale as death; then wept, and prayed again, and said such words——”

“I will not have this girl in the castle,” thought the Unknown. “I was wrong to embark in this business; but I have promised, I have promised: when she is far away——” And looking imperiously at Nibbio, “Now,” said he, “put an end to your compassion; mount a horse, take with you two or three companions, if you wish; go to the castle of Don Roderick, thou knowest it. Tell him to send immediately, immediately—or otherwise——”

But another No, more imperious than the first, whose sound was heard in the depth of his soul, prevented his proceeding. “No,” said he in a determined tone, as if expressing the command of this secret voice,—“no; go to bed; and to-morrow morning you shall do what I shall then order.”

“This girl must have some demon who protects her,” thought he, as he remained alone, with his arms crossed on his breast, regarding the fitful shadows cast by the rays of the moon on the floor, which darted through the grating of the lofty windows. “She must have some demon or an angel who protects her. Compassion in Nibbio! To-morrow morning, to-morrow morning at the latest, she shall be sent away; she must submit to her destiny, that is certain. And,” continued he, with the tone of one who gives a command to a wayward child, under the conviction that he will not obey it, “we will think of it no more. This animal Don Roderick must not come to torment me with thanks, for—I do not wish to hear her spoken of. I have served him—because I promised to do so; and I promised, because it was my destiny. But Don Roderick shall pay me with usury. Let us see——”

And he endeavoured to imagine some difficult enterprise in which to engage Don Roderick as a punishment; but his thoughts involuntarily recurred to another subject. “Compassion in Nibbio! What has she done? I must see her. No! Yes! I must see her.”

He passed through several halls, and arriving at the apartment of the old woman, knocked with his foot at the door.

“Who is there?”

“Open.”

At the sound of this voice, the old woman quickly obeyed, and flung the door wide open. The Unknown threw a glance around the chamber, and by the light of the lantern, which stood on the table, saw Lucy on the floor in one corner of it.

“Why did you place her there?” said he, with a frowning brow.

“She placed herself there,” replied she, timidly. “I have done all I could to encourage her; but she will not listen to me.”

“Rise,” said he to Lucy, who, at the noise of his step, and at the sound of his voice, had been seized with new terror. She buried her face in her hands, and remained silent and trembling before him.

“Rise; I will not harm you; I can befriend you,” said the signor. “Rise!” repeated he, in a voice of thunder, irritated at having spoken in vain.

As if alarm had restored her exhausted strength, the unfortunate girl fell on her knees, clasped her hands on her breast, as if before a sacred image, then with her eyes fixed on the earth, exclaimed, “Here I am, murder me if you will.”

“I have already told you that I will not harm you,” replied the Unknown, in a more gentle tone, gazing at her agonised and altered features.

“Courage, courage,” said the old woman. “He tells you himself that he will not harm you.”

“And why,” resumed Lucy, in a voice in which indignation and despair were mingled with alarm and dismay,—“why make me suffer the torments of hell? What have I done to you?”

“Perhaps they have not treated you kindly? Speak!”

“Oh, kindly treated! They have brought me hither by treachery and force. Why, why did they bring me? Why am I here? Where am I? I am a poor creature. What have I done to you? In the name of God——”

“God! God! always God!” said the Unknown. “Those who are too weak to defend themselves, always make use of the name of God, as if they knew something concerning him! What! do you mean by this word to make me——” and he left the sentence unfinished.

“Oh, signor, what could I mean, a poor girl like me, except that you should have pity on me? God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy! Let me go; for pity, for charity, let me go. Do not make a poor creature suffer thus! Oh, you, who have it in your power, tell them to let me go. They brought me hither by force. Put me again in the carriage with this woman, and let it carry me to my mother. O holy Virgin! My mother! my mother! Perhaps she is not far from here—I thought I saw my mountains! Why do you make me suffer? Carry me to a church; I will pray for you all my life. Does it cost you so much to say one word? Oh, I see that you are touched! Say but the word, say it. God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy.”

“Oh, why is she not the daughter of one of the cowards who outlawed me?” thought the Unknown. “I should then enjoy her sufferings; but now——”

“Do not stifle so good an inspiration,” pursued Lucy, on seeing hesitation in the countenance of her persecutor. “If you do not grant me mercy, the Lord will; he will send death to relieve me, and all will be over. But you—one day, perhaps, you also—but no, no—I will pray the Lord to preserve you from evil. What would it cost you to say one word? If ever you experience these torments——”

“Well, well, take courage,” said the Unknown, with a gentleness that astonished the old woman. “Have I done you any harm? Have I menaced you?”

“Oh, no. I see that you have a good heart, and that you pity a poor creature. If you chose, you could alarm me more than any of them, you could make me die with fear; and on the contrary, you have—you have given me some consolation. God reward you! Accomplish the work you have begun; save me, save me.”

“To-morrow morning.”

“Oh, save me now, now!”

“To-morrow morning I will see you again, I tell you. Be of good courage. Rest yourself. You must need food; it shall be brought to you.”

“No, no, I shall die if any one comes into this room, I shall die. Take me away, God will reward you.”

“A servant will bring you something to eat,” said the Unknown; “and you,” continued he, turning to the old woman, “persuade her to eat, and to repose on the bed. If she consents to have you sleep with her, well; if not, you can sleep very well on the floor. Be kind to her, I say; and take care that she makes no complaint of you.”

He hastily quitted the room, before Lucy could renew her entreaties.

“Oh, miserable that I am! Shut, shut the door!” said Lucy, returning to seat herself in her corner. “Oh, miserable that I am! Who shall I implore now? Where am I? Tell me, tell me, for charity, who is this signor? Who has been talking to me? who is he?”

“Who is he? Do you wish me to tell you? you must wait awhile first. You are proud, because he protects you; provided you are satisfied, no matter what becomes of me. Ask him his name. If I should tell you, he would not speak to me so gently as he did to you. I am an old woman, I am an old woman,” continued she, grumbling: but hearing the sobs of Lucy, she remembered the threat of her master; and addressing her in a less bitter tone, “Well! I have said no harm. Be cheerful. Do not ask me what I cannot tell you, but have courage. How satisfied most people would be, should he speak to them as he has spoken to you! Be cheerful! Directly, you shall have something to eat; and from what he said, I know it will be something good. And then, you must lie down, and you will leave a little room for me,” added she, with an accent of suppressed rancour.

“I cannot eat; I cannot sleep. Leave me, approach me not. You will not go away?”

“No, no,” said the old woman, seating herself on a large arm-chair, and regarding her with a mingled expression of alarm and rage. She looked at the bed, and did not very well relish the idea of being banished from it for the night, as it was very cold; but she hoped at least for a good supper. Lucy felt neither cold nor hunger; she remained stupified with grief and terror; her ideas became vague and confused as in the delirium of a fever.

She shuddered at hearing a knock at the door. “Who is there?” cried she, “who is there? Don't let any one come in.”

“It is only Martha, bringing something to eat.”

“Shut, shut the door!” cried Lucy.

“Certainly,” replied the old woman. Taking a basket from the hands of Martha, she placed it on the table, and closed the door. She invited Lucy to taste the delicious food, bestowing on it profuse praises, and on the wine too, which was such as the signor himself drank with his friends; but seeing that they were useless she said, “It is your own fault, you must not forget to tell him that I asked you. I will eat, however, and leave enough for you, if you should come to your senses.” When her supper was finished she approached Lucy again, and renewed her solicitations.

“No, no, I wish nothing,” replied she, in a faint and exhausted voice. “Is the door shut?” she exclaimed, with momentary energy; “is it well secured?”

The old woman approached the door, and showed her that it was firmly bolted. “You see,” said she, “it is well fastened. Are you satisfied now?”

“Oh! satisfied! satisfied! in this place!” said Lucy, sinking into her corner. “But God knows that I am here.”

“Come to bed. What would you do there, lying like a dog? How silly to refuse comforts when you can have them!”

“No, no, leave me to myself.”

“Well, remember it is your own fault; if you wish to come to bed, you can—I have left room enough for you; remember I have asked you very often.” Thus saying, she drew the clothes over her, and soon all was profound silence.

Lucy remained motionless, with her face buried in her hands, which rested on her knees; she was neither awake nor asleep, but in a dreamy state of the imagination, painful, vague, and changeful. At first, she recalled with something of self-possession the minutest circumstances of this horrible day; then her reason for a moment forsook its throne, vainly struggling against the phantoms conjured by uncertainty and terror; at last, weary and exhausted, she sunk on the floor, in a state approaching to, and resembling, sleep. But suddenly she awoke, as at an internal call, and strove to recall her scattered senses, to know where she was, and why she had been brought thither. She heard a noise, and listened; it was the heavy breathing of the old woman, in a deep slumber; she opened her eyes on the objects around her, which the flickering of the lamp, now dying in its socket, rendered confused and indistinct. But soon her recent impressions returned distinctly to her mind, and the unfortunate girl recognised her prison; and with the knowledge came associated all the terrors of this horrible day; and, overcome anew by anxiety and terror, she wished earnestly for death. She could only pray, and as the words fell from her trembling lips, she felt her confidence revive. Suddenly a thought presented itself to her mind; that her prayer would be more acceptable if united with an offering of something dear to her; she remembered the object to which she had clung for her happiness, and resolved to sacrifice it; then clasping her hands over her chaplet, which hung upon her neck, and raising her tearful eyes to heaven, she cried, “O most holy Virgin! thou to whom I have so often prayed, and who hast so often consoled me—thou who hast suffered so much sorrow, and art now so glorious—thou who hast performed so many miracles for the afflicted—holy Virgin! succour me, take me from this peril, mother of God! return me safely to my mother, and I pledge myself to remain devoted to thy service; I renounce for ever the unfortunate youth, and from this time devote myself to thee!” After this consecration of herself, she felt her confidence and faith increase; she remembered the “to-morrow morning” uttered by the Unknown, and took it as a promise of safety. Her wearied senses yielded to this new sentiment, and she slept profoundly and peacefully with the name of her protectress on her lips.

But in this same castle was one who could not sleep: after having quitted Lucy, and given orders for her supper, he had visited the posts of his fortress; but her image remained stamped on his mind, her words still resounded in his ears. He retired to his chamber, and threw himself on his bed; but in the stillness around this same image of Lucy in her desolation and anguish took possession still more absolutely of his thoughts, and rendered sleep hopeless. “What new feelings are these?” thought he. “Nibbio was right; but what is there in a woman's tears to unman me thus? Did I never see a woman weep before? Ay, and how often have I beheld their deepest agonies unmoved? But now——”

And here he recalled, without much difficulty, many an instance when neither prayers nor tears were able to make him swerve from his atrocious purposes; but instead of deriving augmented resolution, as he had hoped, from the recollection, he experienced an emotion of alarm, of consternation; so that even, as a relief from the torment of retrospection, he thought of Lucy. “She lives still,” said he, “she is here; there is yet time. I have it in my power to say to her, Go in peace! I can also ask her forgiveness. Forgiveness! I ask forgiveness of a woman! Ah, if in that word existed the power to drive this demon from my soul, I would say it; yes, I feel that I would say it. To what am I reduced? I am no longer myself! Well, well! many a time have such follies passed through my head; this will take its flight also.”

And to procure the desired forgetfulness, he endeavoured to busy himself with some new project; but in vain: all appeared changed! that which at another time would have been a stimulus to action, had now lost its charm; his imagination was overwhelmed with the insupportable weight of remembered crimes. Even the idea of continuing to associate with those whom he had employed as the instruments of his daring and licentious will was revolting to his soul; and, disgusted and weary, he found relief only in the thought that by the dawn of morning he would set at liberty the unfortunate Lucy.

“I will save her; yes, I will save her. As soon as the day breaks, I will fly to her, and say, Go, go in peace. But my promise! Ay, who is Don Roderick that I should hold sacred a promise made to him?” With the perplexity of a man to whom a superior addresses unexpectedly an embarrassing question, the Unknown endeavoured to reply to this his own, or, rather, that was whispered by this new principle, that had of a sudden sprung up so awfully in his soul, to pass judgment upon him. He wondered how he could have resolved to engage himself to inflict suffering, without any motive of hatred or fear, on an unfortunate being whom he did not know, only to render a service to this man. He could not find any excuse for it; he could not even imagine how he had been led to do it. The hasty determination had been the impulse of a mind obedient to its habitual feelings, the consequence of a thousand previous deeds; and from an examination of the motives which had led him to commit a single deed, he was led to the retrospection of his whole life.

In looking back from year to year, from enterprise to enterprise, from crime to crime, from blood to blood, each one of his actions appeared abstracted from the feelings which had induced their perpetration, and therefore exposed in all their horrible deformity, but which those feelings had hitherto veiled from his view. They were all his own, he was responsible for all; they comprised his life; the horror of this thought filled him with despair; he grasped his pistol, and raised it to his head—but at the moment in which he would have terminated his miserable existence, his thoughts rushed onwards to the time that must continue to flow on after his end. He thought of his disfigured corpse, without sense or motion, in the power of the vilest men; the astonishment and confusion which would take place in the castle, the conversation it would excite in the neighbourhood and afar off, and, more than all, the rejoicing of his enemies. The darkness and silence of the night inspired him with other apprehensions still; it appeared to him that he would not have hesitated to perform the deed in open day, in the presence of others. “And, after all, what was it? but a moment, and all would be over.” And now another thought rose to his mind: “If that other life, of which they tell, is an invention of priests, is a mere fabrication, why should I die? Of what consequence is all that I have done? It is a trifle—but if there should be another life!”

At such a doubt, he was filled with deeper despair, a despair from which death appeared no refuge. The pistol dropped from his grasp—both hands were applied to his aching head—and he trembled in every limb. Suddenly the words he had heard a few hours before came to his memory, “God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy.” They did not come to him clothed in the humble tone of supplication, with which he had heard them pronounced, but in one of authority which offered some gleam of hope. It was a moment of relief: he brought to mind the figure of Lucy, when she uttered them; and he regarded her, not as a suppliant, but as an angel of consolation. He waited with anxiety the approach of day, that he might hear from her mouth other words of hope and life. He imagined himself conducting her to her mother, “And then, what shall I do to-morrow? what shall I do for the rest of the day? what shall I do the day after, and the next day? and the night? the night which will so soon return? Oh, the night! let me not think of the night!” And, plunged in the frightful void of the future, he sought in vain for some employment of time, some method of living through the days and nights. Now he thought of abandoning his castle, and flying to some distant country, where he had never been heard of; but, could he fly from himself? Then he felt a confused hope of recovering his former courage and habits; and that he should regard these terrors of his soul but as a transient delirium: now, he dreaded the approach of day, which should exhibit him so miserably changed to his followers; then he longed for its light, as if it would bring light also to his troubled thoughts. As the day broke, a confused sound of merriment broke upon his ear. He listened; it was a distant chiming of bells, and he could hear the echo of the mountains repeat the harmony, and mingle itself with it. From another quarter, still nearer, and then from another, similar sounds were heard. “What means this?” said he. “For what are these rejoicings? What joyful event has taken place?” He rose from his bed of thorns, and opened the window.

The mountains were still half veiled in darkness, the heavens appeared enveloped in a heavy and vast cloud; but he distinguished, through the faint dawn of the morning, crowds passing towards the opening on the right of the castle, villagers in their holyday garments. “What are those people doing? what has happened to cause all this joy?” And calling a bravo, who slept in the adjoining room, he asked him the cause of the commotion. The man replied that he was ignorant of it, but would go immediately and enquire. His master remained at the window, contemplating the moving spectacle, which increasing day rendered more distinct every moment. He saw crowds passing in succession; men, women, and children, as guided by one impulse, directing their steps in one direction. They appeared animated by a common joy; and the bells, with their united sound of merriment, seemed to be an echo of the general hilarity. The Unknown looked on intently, and felt an eager curiosity to know what could have communicated such happiness to such a multitude of people.
CHAPTER XXII.

The bravo hastened back with the intelligence, that the Cardinal Frederick Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, had arrived the evening before at ***, and was expected to pass the day there. The report of his arrival being spread abroad, the people had been seized with a desire to see him; and the bells were rung in testimony of the happiness his presence conferred, and also to give wider notice of his arrival. The Unknown, left alone, continued to look down into the valley—“For a man! all crowding, all eager to see a man! And, nevertheless, each one of them has some demon that torments him; but none, none, a demon like mine; not one has passed such a night as I have. What is there in this man to excite such joy? Some silver which he will scatter among them.—But all are not actuated by such a motive. Well, a few words—Oh! if he had a few words of consolation for me! Yes—why should I not go to him? Why not? I will go. What better can I do? I will go and speak to him; speak to him alone. What shall I say to him? Why, why, that which——I will hear what he will say to me.”

Having come to this vague determination, he threw over his shoulders a military cloak, put his pistol and dagger in his girdle, and took from the wall, where it hung, a carabine almost as famous as himself; thus accoutred, he proceeded to Lucy's chamber, and leaving his carabine at the door, he knocked and demanded admittance. The old woman hastened to open the door; he entered, and looking around the room saw Lucy tranquil and silent in the corner of it.

“Does she sleep?” asked he in a low voice. “Why did you suffer her to sleep there? Were these my orders?”

“I did all I could; but she would neither eat nor come——”

“Let her sleep then in peace; be careful not to trouble her, and when she wakes—Martha will be in the next chamber, and you must send her for whatever she may want—when she wakes—tell her I——that the signor has gone out for a little while, that he will return, and that—he will do all that she wishes.”

The old woman was astonished; “She must be some princess,” thought she.

The Unknown departed, took his carabine, gave orders to Martha to be in waiting, and to a bravo to guard the chamber, and not suffer any one to approach; then leaving the castle, with rapid steps he descended into the valley. The bravoes whom he met ascending the hill, stopped respectfully at his approach, expecting and awaiting orders for some expedition, and were astonished at his whole appearance, and the looks with which he returned their salute.

When he reached the public road, his presence made a very different impression; at his approach every one gave way, regarding him with looks of suspicion and wonder; each individual whom he met, cast at him a troubled look, bowed, and slackened his pace, in order to remain behind. He arrived at the village in the midst of the throng; his name quickly spread from mouth to mouth, and a passage was instantly made for him to pass. He enquired of one near him where the cardinal was. “In the house of the curate,” replied the person, respectfully pointing to it. He went to it, entered a small court where there were several priests, who looked at him with astonishment and suspicion. He saw, opposite to him, a door open, which led to a small hall, in which were also a great collection of priests. He left his carabine in a corner of the court, and entered the hall. He was received here, likewise, with doubting looks, and whispers; and his name was repeated with infinite awe. He accosted one of them, asking to be directed to the cardinal, as he wished to speak with him.

“I am a stranger,” replied the priest; and looking around upon the assembly, he called the cross-bearer, who at the time was saying to one near him, “He here!—the famous—— What can have brought him here? Make room!” At this call, which resounded in the general silence, he felt himself compelled to advance. He bowed before the Unknown, raised his eyes in uneasy curiosity to his face, and understanding his request, he stammered out, “I do not know if his illustrious lordship—at this time—is—can—however, I will go and see.” And he went, against his will, to carry the message to the cardinal.

At this period of our history we cannot do otherwise than rest a while, as the traveller worn out and weary with a long journey through a sterile and savage land, refreshes himself for a season under the shade of a tree, near a fountain of living water. We are about to introduce a person whose name and memory cause an emotion of respect and sympathy; and this emotion is the more grateful from our previous contemplation of wickedness and crime. We trust our readers will excuse our devoting a few moments to this great and good man.

Frederick Borromeo, born in the year 1564, was one of those rare characters who have employed a fine genius, the resources of great wealth, the advantages of privileged rank, and unceasing industry, for the discovery and practice of that which was for the good of mankind. His life was like a stream, which, issuing limpid from its native rock, moves on undefiled over various lands; and, clear and limpid still, unites itself with the ocean. In the midst of the pomps and pleasures of the world, he applied himself from his earliest youth to study and obey the precepts of religion; and this application produced in his heart its legitimate fruits. He took truth for the rule of his thoughts and actions. He was taught by it not to look upon this life as a burthen to the many, and a pleasure to the few; but as a scene of activity for all, and of which all must render their account; and the chief aim of his thoughts had ever been to render his life useful and holy.

In 1580, he declared his resolution to devote himself to the ministry of the church, and he took the habit from the hands of his cousin Carlos, whom the public voice, even to the present day, has uniformly acknowledged as a saint.[31] He entered a short time after into the college at Pavia, founded by that holy man, and which still bears the name of the family. There, whilst applying himself with assiduity to the occupations prescribed by its rules, he voluntarily imposed on himself, in addition, the task of instructing the poor and ignorant in the principles of the Christian religion, and of visiting, consoling, and aiding the sick. He made use of the authority which was conceded to him by all, to induce his companions to second him in these deeds of benevolence; he steadily refused all worldly advantages, and led a life of self-denial and devotion to the cause of religion and virtue. The complaints of his kindred, who thought the dignity of the house degraded by his plain and simple habits of life, were unavailing. He had another conflict to sustain with the ecclesiastical authorities, who wished to impel him forward to distinction, and make him appear as the prince of the place. From all this, however, he carefully withdrew himself, although at the time but a youth.

It would not have been astonishing that, during the life of his cousin Carlos, Frederick should have imitated the example and followed the counsel of so good a man; but it was surprising, that after his death no one could perceive that Frederick, although only twenty years of age, had lost his guardian and guide. The increasing splendour of his talents, his piety, the support of many powerful cardinals, the authority of his family, the name itself, to which Carlos had caused to be associated an idea of sanctity and sacerdotal superiority, all concurred to point him out as a proper subject for ecclesiastical dignity. But he, persuaded in the depth of his soul of that which no true Christian can deny, that a man has no real superiority over others, but in devotion to their good, dreaded distinction, and sought to avoid it. He did not wish to escape from the obligation to serve his neighbour; his life was but one scene of such services; but he did not esteem himself worthy of so high and responsible an office. Governed by such feelings, in 1595, when Clement VIII. offered him the archbishopric of Milan, he refused it without hesitation, but was finally obliged to yield to the express command of the pope.

Such demonstrations are neither difficult nor rare; it is no greater effort for hypocrisy to assume them, than for raillery to deride them. But are they not also the natural expression of wise and virtuous feeling? The life is the test of sincerity; and though all the hypocrites in the world had assumed the expression of virtuous sentiments, yet the sentiments themselves will always command our respect and veneration, when their genuineness is evinced by a life of disinterestedness and self-sacrifice.

Frederick, as archbishop, was careful to reserve for himself only that which was barely necessary, of his time and his wealth: he said, as all the world says, that the ecclesiastical revenues are the patrimony of the poor; and we shall see how he put this maxim in practice. He caused an estimate to be made of the sum necessary for his expenses, and for those employed in his service: finding it to be 600 sequins, he ordered that amount to be taken from his patrimonial revenues for the supply of his table. He exercised such minute economy with regard to himself, that he did not relinquish any article of dress until it was entirely worn out; but he joined to these habits of extreme simplicity, an exquisite neatness, which was remarkable in this age of luxury and uncleanliness. He did more: in order that nothing should be lost from the fragments of his frugal table, he assigned them to a hospital for the poor, and a servant came every day to gather the remnants for that purpose. From the attention which he paid to such minutiæ, we might form a contracted idea of his mind, as being incapable of elevating itself to more extensive designs, were it not for the Ambrosian library, which remains a monument of his liberality and magnificence. To furnish it with books and manuscripts, besides those which he had already collected, he sent eight of the most skilful and learned men to make purchases of them in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Flanders, Greece, Lebanon, and Jerusalem. He succeeded in collecting 30,000 printed volumes, and 14,000 manuscripts. He joined to the library a college of doctors: these doctors were nine in number, and supported by him as long as he lived; after his death, the ordinary revenues not being sufficient for the expense, they were reduced to two. Their duty consisted in the cultivation of the various branches of human knowledge, theology, history, belles lettres, ecclesiastical antiquities, and Oriental languages. Each one was obliged to publish some work on the subject to which he had particularly applied himself. He added to this a college, which he called Trilingue[32], for the study of the Greek, Latin, and Italian languages; and a college of pupils, who were instructed in these languages to become professors in their turn. He united to these also a printing establishment for the Oriental languages, for Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, Persian, and Armenian; a gallery of pictures, and another of statues; and a school for the three principal arts of design. For the latter, he was at no loss to find professors; but this was not the case with regard to the Eastern languages, which were at this time but little cultivated in Europe. In the orders which he left for the government and regulations of the library, we perceive a perpetual attention to utility, admirable in itself, and much in advance of the ordinary ideas of his time. He prescribed to the librarian the cultivation of a regular correspondence with the learned men of Europe, to keep himself acquainted with the state of science, and to procure every new and important work; he also charged him to point out to young students the books necessary for them, and, whether natives or foreigners, to afford them every possible facility in making use of those of the library. There is a history of the Ambrosian library by one Pierpaolo Bosca, who was librarian after the death of Frederick, in which all the excellent regulations are minutely detailed. Other libraries existed in Italy, but with little benefit to the studious: the books were carefully concealed from view in their cases, and inaccessible to all, except on rare occasions, and with the utmost difficulty. A book might then be seen, but not studied. It is useless to enquire what were the fruits of these establishments of Borromeo, but we must admire the generosity, judgment, and benevolence of the man who could undertake and execute such things, in the midst of the ignorance, inertness, and general indifference which surrounded him. And in attention to public, he was not unmindful of private benevolence; indeed, his whole life was a perpetual almsgiving; on the occasion of the famine of which our history has spoken, we may have to relate more than one instance of his wisdom and generosity.

The inexhaustible charity of the man shone as much in his private charities, as in his splendid and magnificent public establishments already recorded. On one occasion he saved a young lady from being immured in a convent against her wish. Her selfish father pretended he could not marry her suitably without a portion of 4000 crowns. The bishop advanced the money.

Easy of access, he made it a principle to receive the poor who applied to him, with kindness and affection. And on this point he was obliged to dispute with the nobility, who wished to keep him to their standard of action. One day, whilst visiting among the mountaineers, and instructing some poor children, Frederick bestowed caresses on them. A nobleman who was present, warned him to be careful, as the children were dirty and disgusting. The good bishop, not without indignation, replied, “These souls are committed to my care; these children may never see me again; and are you not willing that I should embrace them?”

He, however, seldom felt indignation or anger: he was admired for a placability, a sweetness of manner nearly imperturbable; which, however, was not natural to him, but the effect of continual combat against a quick and hasty disposition. If ever he appeared harsh, it was to those subordinate pastors, whom he found guilty of avarice, or negligence, or any other vice opposed to the spirit of their high calling. With regard to his own interests or temporal glory, he exhibited no emotion, either of joy or regret; admirable indeed, if his spirit was in reality not affected by these emotions; but more admirable still, if viewed as the result of continued and unremitted effort to subdue them. And amidst all the important cares with which he was occupied, he did not neglect the cultivation of his mind; he devoted himself to literature with so much ardour, that he became one of the most learned men of his time.

We must not, however, conceal that he adopted with firm persuasion, and maintained with constancy, certain opinions, which at this day would appear singular and ill-founded; these, however, were the errors of his time, and not his own.

Our readers may perhaps enquire, if so learned and studious a man has left no monument of his labours and studies? His works, great and small, Latin and Italian, printed as well as manuscript, amount to more than a hundred; they are preserved with care in the library which he founded. They are composed of moral treatises, sermons, historical dissertations, sacred and profane antiquities, literature, the fine arts, &c.

And what is the reason that they are so little known, so little sought for? We cannot enter into the causes of this phenomenon, as our explanation might not be satisfactory to our readers. So that we had better resume the course of our history, in relating facts concerning this extraordinary man.
CHAPTER XXIII.

The Cardinal Frederick was engaged in study, as was his custom, preparatory to the hour of divine service, when the cross-bearer entered, with a disturbed and unquiet air.

“A strange visit,—strange indeed, most illustrious signor.”

“From whom?” asked the cardinal.

“From the signor ——,” replied the chaplain; pronouncing the name which we are unable to repeat to our readers. “He is without, in person, and asks admittance to the presence of your lordship.”

“Indeed!” said the cardinal, closing his book and rising from his seat, his countenance brightening; “let him come in, let him come in immediately.”

“But——,” replied the chaplain, “does your lordship know who this man is? It is the famous outlaw ——.”

“And is it not a happy circumstance for a bishop, that such a man should have come to seek him?”

“But——,” insisted the chaplain, “we never dare speak of certain things, because my lord says they are idle tales. However, in this case it appears to be a duty——. Zeal makes enemies, my lord, and we know that more than one ruffian has boasted that sooner or later——”

“And what have they done?”

“This man is an enterprising, desperate villain, who is in strict correspondence with other villains, as desperate as himself, and who, perhaps, have sent him——”

“Oh! what discipline is this!” said the cardinal, smiling; “the soldiers exhort the general to cowardice!” Then, with a grave and pensive air, he resumed, “Saint Carlo would not have deliberated a moment, whether he should receive such a man; he would have gone to seek him. Let him enter immediately; he has already waited too long.”

The chaplain moved towards the door, saying in his heart, “There is no remedy; these saints are always obstinate.”

He opened the door, and reaching the hall, where he had left the ecclesiastics, he beheld them collected together in one corner of the room, and the Unknown standing alone in another. As he approached him, he eyed him keenly to ascertain whether he had not arms concealed about his person. “Truly, before introducing him, we might at least propose——,” but his resolution failed him. He spoke—“My lord expects your lordship. Be kind enough to come with me.” And he led the way into the presence of Frederick, who came forward to meet the Unknown with a pleased and serene countenance, making a sign to the chaplain to quit the room.

The Unknown and the cardinal remained for some moments silent and undecided; the former experienced at the same time a vague hope of finding some relief to his internal torments, and also a degree of irritation and shame at appearing in this place as a penitent, to confess his sins, and implore pardon of a man. He could not speak; indeed, he hardly wished to do so. However, as he raised his eyes to the cardinal's face, he was seized with an irresistible sentiment of respect, which increasing his confidence, and subduing his pride without offending it, nevertheless kept him silent.

The person of Frederick was indeed fitted to inspire respect and love. His figure was naturally majestic and noble, and was neither bent nor wasted by years; his eye was grave and piercing, his brow serene and pensive; his countenance still shone with the animation of youth, notwithstanding the paleness of his face, and the visible traces it presented of abstinence, meditation, and laborious exertion. All his features indicated that he had once been more than ordinarily handsome; the habit of solemn and benevolent thought, the internal peace of a long life, love for mankind, and the influence of an ineffable hope, had substituted for the beauty of youth, the more dignified and superior beauty of an old age, to which the magnificent simplicity of the purple added an imposing and inexpressible charm. He kept his eyes for a few moments fixed on the Unknown, as if to read his thoughts; and imagining he perceived in his dark and troubled features something corresponding to the hope he had conceived, “Oh!” cried he in an animated voice, “what a welcome visit is this! and how I ought to thank you for it, although it fills me with self-reproach.”

“Reproach!” cried the Unknown, in astonishment; but he felt re-assured by his manner, and the gentleness of his words, and he was glad that the cardinal had broken the ice, and commenced the conversation.

“Certainly, it is a subject of self-reproach that I should have waited till you came to me! How many times I might, and ought to have sought you!”

“You! seek me! Do you know who I am? Have they told you my name?”

“Do you believe I could have felt this joy, which you may read in my countenance—do you believe I could have felt it, at the sight of one unknown to me? It is you who are the cause of it—you, whom it was my duty to seek—you, for whom I have so wept and prayed—you, who are that one of my children (and I love them all with the whole strength of my affections)—that one, whom I would most have desired to see and embrace, if I could have ever dared to indulge the hope of so doing. But God alone can work miracles, and he supplies the weakness and tardiness of his poor servants.”

The Unknown was amazed at the kindness and warmth of this reception; agitated and bewildered by such unlooked-for benevolence, he kept silence.

“And,” resumed Frederick, more affectionately, “you have some good news for me; why do you hesitate to tell it me?”

“Good news! I! I have hell in my soul, and how can I bring you good news! Tell me, tell me, if you know, what good news could you expect from such a one as I?”

“That God has touched your heart, and is drawing you to himself,” replied the cardinal calmly.

“God! God! If I could see! If I could hear him! Where is God?”

“Do you ask me? you! And who more than yourself has felt his presence? Do you not now feel him in your heart, disturbing, agitating you, not leaving you a moment of repose, and at the same time drawing you towards him, and imparting a hope of tranquillity and of consolation; of consolation which shall be full and unlimited, as soon as you acknowledge Him, confess your sins, and implore his mercy!”

“Oh! yes, yes; something indeed oppresses, something consumes me. But God—if it be God, if it be He, of whom you speak, what can he do with me?”

These words were uttered in a tone of despair; but Frederick calmly and solemnly replied, “What can God do with you? Through you he can exhibit his power and goodness. He would draw from you a glory, which none other could render him; you, against whom, the cries of the world have been for so long a time raised—you, whose deeds are detested——” (The Unknown started at this unaccustomed language, but was astonished to find that it excited no anger in his bosom, but rather communicated to it a degree of alleviation.) “What glory,” pursued Frederick, “will accrue to God? A general cry of supplication has risen against you before his throne; among your accusers, some no doubt have been stimulated by jealousy of the power you have exercised; but more, by the deplorable security of your own heart, which has endured until this day. But, when you yourself shall rise to condemn your life, and become your own accuser, then, oh! then, God will be glorified! And you ask what he can do with you? What am I, feeble mortal! that I should presume to tell you what are his designs respecting you; what he will do with this impetuous will, and imperturbable constancy, when he shall have animated and warmed it with love, hope, and repentance? Who are you, feeble mortal, that you should think yourself able to execute and imagine greater things for the promotion of evil and vice, than God can make you accomplish for that of good and virtue? What can God do with you? Forgive you! save you! accomplish in you the work of redemption! Are not these things worthy of him? Oh! speak. If I, an humble creature—I, so miserable, and nevertheless so full of myself—I, such as I am,—if I so rejoice at your salvation, that to assure it, I would joyfully give (God is my witness) the few years that remain to me in life, Oh! think! what must be the love of Him who inspires me with the thought, and commands me to regard you with such devotion as this!”

The countenance and manner of Frederick breathed celestial purity and love, in accordance with the vows which came from his mouth. The Unknown felt the stormy emotions of his soul gradually calming under such heavenly influence, and giving place to sentiments of deep and profound interest. His eyes, which from infancy “had been unused to tears, became swoln;” and burying his face in his hands, he wept the reply he could not utter.

“Great and good God!” cried Frederick, raising his hands and eyes to heaven, “what have I ever done—I, thy unprofitable servant—that thou shouldst have invited me to this banquet of thy grace,—that thou shouldst have thought me worthy of being thy instrument to the accomplishment of such a miracle!” So saying, he extended his hand to take that of the Unknown.

“No!” cried he; “no! Approach me not! Pollute not that innocent and beneficent hand! You know not what deeds have been committed by the hand you would place within your own!”

“Suffer,” said Frederick, taking it with gentle violence,—“suffer me to clasp this hand, which is about to repair so many wrongs, to scatter so many blessings; which will comfort so many who are in affliction, which will offer itself, peaceably and humbly, to so many enemies.”

“It is too much,” said the Unknown, sobbing aloud; “leave me, my lord! good Frederick! leave me! Crowds eagerly await your presence, among whom are pure and innocent souls, who have come from far to see and hear you, and you remain here to converse——with whom?”

“We will leave the ninety and nine sheep,” replied the cardinal; “they are in safety on the mountain. I must now remain with the one which was lost. These people are perhaps now more satisfied than if they had the poor bishop with them; perhaps God, who has visited you with the riches and wonders of his grace, may even now be filling their hearts with a joy, of which they divine not the cause; perhaps they are united to us without knowing it; perhaps the Holy Spirit animates their hearts with the fervour of charity and benevolence; inspires them with a spirit of prayer; with, on your account, a spirit of thanksgiving of which you are the unknown object.”

So saying, he passed his arm around the neck of the Unknown, who, after resisting a moment, yielded, quite vanquished by this impulse of kindness, and fell on the neck of the cardinal, in an agony of repentance. His burning tears dropped on the stainless purple of Frederick, and the pure hands of the bishop were clasped affectionately around him, who had hitherto been only habituated to deeds of violence and treachery.

The Unknown, after a long embrace, covering his face with his hands, raised his head, exclaiming, “Oh! God! Thou who art truly great and good! I know myself now; I comprehend what I am; my iniquities are all before me; I abhor myself; but still—still I experience a consolation, a joy—yes, a joy which I have never before known in all my horrible life!”

“God accords to you this grace,” said Frederick, “to attract you to his service, to strengthen you to enter resolutely the new way he has opened to you, where you have so much to undo, to repair, to weep for!”

“Miserable that I am!” cried he, “there is so much—so much—that I can only weep over. But at least, there are some things but just undertaken, that I can arrest—yes, there is at least one evil that I can repair.”

He then briefly related, in the most energetic terms of self-execration, the story of Lucy, with the sufferings and terrors of the unfortunate girl; her entreaties, and the species of frenzy that her supplications had excited in his soul; adding, that she was still in the castle.

“Ah! let us lose no time!” cried Frederick, moved with pity and solicitude. “What happiness for you! You may behold in this, the pledge of pardon! God makes you the instrument of safety to her, to whom you were to have been the instrument of ruin. God has indeed blessed you!—Do you know the native place of the unhappy girl?”

The Unknown named the village.

“It is not far from this,” said the cardinal; “God be praised! And probably——” so saying, he approached a table, and rang a little bell. The chaplain entered, with an unquiet look; in amazement he beheld the altered countenance of the Unknown, on which the traces of tears were still visible; and glancing at that of the cardinal, he perceived, through its wonted calmness, an expression of great satisfaction, mingled with extraordinary solicitude. He was roused from the astonishment which the contemplation excited, by a question of the cardinal, if, among the curates in the hall, “there was one from ***?”

“There is, most illustrious lord,” replied the chaplain.

“Bring him hither immediately,” said Frederick, “and with him, the curate of this parish.”

The chaplain obeyed, and went to the hall where the priests were assembled. All eyes were turned towards him. He cried aloud, “His most illustrious and reverend lordship asks for the curate of this parish and the curate of ***.”

The former advanced immediately, and at the same time was heard, amidst the crowd, a me? uttered in a tone of surprise.

“Are you not the curate of ***?” said the chaplain.

“Certainly; but——”

“His most illustrious and reverend lordship asks for you.”

“Me?” replied he, and Don Abbondio advanced from the crowd with an air of amazement and anxiety. The chaplain led the way, and introduced them both to the presence of the cardinal.

The cardinal let go the hand of the Unknown as they entered, and taking the curate of the parish aside, related in few words the facts of the story, asking him if he knew some kind female, who would be willing to go to the castle in a litter, to remove Lucy thence; a devoted, charitable woman, capable of acting with judgment in so novel an expedition, and of exerting the best means to tranquillise the poor girl, to whom deliverance itself, after such anguish and alarm, might produce new and overwhelming apprehensions. After having reflected a moment, the curate took upon himself the affair, and departed. The cardinal then ordered the chaplain to have a litter prepared, and two mules ready saddled. The chaplain quitted the room to obey his orders, and the cardinal was left alone with Don Abbondio and the Unknown. The former, who had kept himself aloof, regarding with eager curiosity the faces of the Unknown and the cardinal, now came forward, saying, “I was told that your illustrious lordship wished to see me; but I suppose it was a mistake.”

“There is no mistake;” replied Frederick, “I have both a novel and agreeable commission to give you. One of your parishioners, whom you have regarded as lost, Lucy Mondella, is found; she is near this, in the house of my good friend here. I wish you to go with him, and a good woman whom the curate of this parish will provide, and bring the poor girl, who must be so dear to you, to this place.”

Don Abbondio did his best to conceal the extreme alarm which such a proposition caused him; and bowed profoundly, in sign of obedience, first to the cardinal, and then to the Unknown, but with a piteous look, which seemed to say, “I am in your hands; be merciful: parcere subjectis.”

The cardinal asked him of Lucy's relations.

“She has no near relation but her mother, with whom she lives,” replied Don Abbondio.

“Is she at home?”

“Yes, my lord.”

“Since,” replied Frederick, “this poor child cannot yet go home, it would be a great consolation for her to see her mother; if the curate of this village does not return before I go to church, I beg you will desire him to send some prudent person to bring the good woman hither.”

“Perhaps I had better go myself,” said Don Abbondio.

“No, no; I have other employment for you.”

“Her mother,” resumed Don Abbondio, “is a very sensitive woman, and it will require a good deal of discretion to prepare her for the meeting.”

“That is the reason that I have named some prudent person. You, however, will be more useful elsewhere,” replied the cardinal. He could have added, had he not been deterred by a regard to the feelings of the Unknown—“This poor child needs much to behold some person whom she knows, after so many hours of alarm, and in such terrible uncertainty of the future.”

It appeared strange, however, that Don Abbondio should not have inferred it from his manner, or that he should not have thought so himself; the reluctance he evinced to comply with the request of the cardinal appeared so out of place, that the latter imagined there must be some secret cause for it. He looked at the curate attentively, and quickly discovering the fears of the poor man at becoming the companion of this formidable lord, or entering his abode, even for a few moments, he felt an anxiety to dissipate these terrors; and in order to do this, and not injure the feelings of his new friend by talking privately to Don Abbondio in his presence, he addressed his conversation to the Unknown himself, so that Don Abbondio might perceive by his answers, that he was no longer a man to be feared.

“Do not believe,” said he, “that I shall be satisfied with this visit to-day. You will return, will you not, in company with this worthy ecclesiastic?”

“Will I return!” replied the Unknown: “Oh! if ever you should refuse to see me, I would remain at your door as a beggar. I must talk to you, I must hear you, I must see you, I cannot do without you!”

Frederick took his hand, and pressing it affectionately, said, “Do us the favour, then, the curate of the village and myself, to dine with us; I shall expect you. In the mean time, whilst you are gathering the first fruits of repentance and compassion, I will go and offer supplications and thanksgivings to God with the people.”

Don Abbondio, at this exhibition of confidence and affection, was like a timid child, who beholds a man caressing fearlessly a rough-looking mastiff, renowned for his ferocity and strength. It is in vain that the master assures him the dog is a good quiet beast: he looks at him, neither contradicting nor assenting; he looks at the dog, and dares not approach him, lest the good beast might show his teeth, if only from habit; he dares not retreat, from fear of the imputation of cowardice; but he heartily wishes himself safe “at home!”

The cardinal, as he was quitting the room, still holding the Unknown by the hand, perceived that the curate remained behind, embarrassed and motionless, and thinking that perhaps he was mortified at the little attention that was paid to him, compared with that which was bestowed on one so criminal, he turned towards him, stopped a moment, and with an amiable smile said, “Signor Curate, you have always been with me in the house of our Father; but this man perierat, et inventus est.”

“Oh! how I rejoice at it!” said the curate, bowing to them both very reverently.

The archbishop passed on, and entering the hall, the admirable pair presented themselves to the eager gaze of the clergy who were there assembled. They regarded with intense curiosity those two countenances, on which were depicted different, but equally profound emotions. The venerable features of Frederick breathed a grateful and humble joy; in those of the Unknown might be traced an embarrassment blended with satisfaction, an unusual modesty, a keen remorse, through which, however, the lingerings of his severe and savage nature were apparent. More than one of the spectators thought of that passage of Isaiah, “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.” Behind them came Don Abbondio, whom no one noticed.

When they had reached the middle of the apartment, the servant of the cardinal entered, to inform him that he had executed the orders of the chaplain, that the litter was ready, and that they only waited for the female whom the curate was to bring. The cardinal told him to inform Don Abbondio when the curate should have arrived, and that afterwards all would be subject to his orders and those of the Unknown, to whom he bade an affectionate farewell, saying, “I shall expect you.” Bowing to Don Abbondio, he directed his steps, followed by the clergy in procession, to the church.

Don Abbondio and the Unknown were left alone in the apartment; the latter was absorbed in his own thoughts, impatient for the moment to arrive when he should take his Lucy from sorrow and prison; for she was indeed his Lucy, but in a sense very different from the preceding night. His countenance expressed concentrated agitation, which to the suspicious eye of Don Abbondio appeared something worse: he looked at him with a desire to begin a friendly conversation. “But what can I say to him?” thought he. “Shall I repeat to him that I rejoice? I rejoice! at what? That having been a demon, he has formed the resolution to become an honest man? A pretty salutation, indeed! Eh! eh! however I should arrange my words, my I rejoice would signify nothing else! And can one believe that he has become an honest man all in a moment! Assertions prove nothing; it is so easy to make them! But, nevertheless, I must go with him to the castle! Oh! who would have told me this, this morning! Oh! if ever I am so happy as to get home again, Perpetua shall answer for having urged me to come here! Oh! miserable that I am! I must however say something to this man!” He had at least thought of something to say,—“I never expected the pleasure of being in such respectable company,”—and had opened his mouth to speak, when the servant entered with the curate of the village, who informed them that the good woman was in the litter awaiting them. Don Abbondio, approaching the servant, said to him, “Give me a gentle beast, for, to say truth, I am not a skilful horseman.”

“Be quite easy,” replied the valet, with a smile; “it is the mule of the secretary, a grave man of letters.”

“Well,” replied Don Abbondio, and continued to himself, “Heaven preserve me!”

The Unknown had advanced towards the door, but looking back, and seeing Don Abbondio behind, he suddenly recollected himself, and bowing with a polite and humble air, waited to let him pass before. This circumstance re-assured the poor man a little; but he had scarcely reached the little court, when he saw the Unknown resume his carbine, and fling it over his shoulder, as if performing the military exercise.

“Oh! oh! oh!” thought Don Abbondio, “what does he want with this tool? That is a strange ornament for a converted person! And if some whim should enter his head! what would become of me! what would become of me!”

If the Unknown had had the least suspicion of the thoughts that were passing in the mind of his companion, he would have done his utmost to inspire him with confidence; but he was far from such an imagination, as Don Abbondio was very careful not to let his distrust appear.

They found the mules ready at the door: the Unknown mounted one which was presented to him by a groom.

“Is she not vicious in the least?” asked Don Abbondio of the servant, with his foot in the stirrup.

“Be quite easy, she is a lamb,” replied he. Don Abbondio climbed to the saddle, by the aid of the servant, and was at last safely mounted.

The litter, which was a few steps in advance, moved at a call from the driver, and the convoy departed.

They had to pass before the church, which was crowded with people, and through a small square, which was filled with villagers from abroad, who had not been able to find a place within the walls of the church. The report had already spread; and when they saw the carriage appear, and beheld the man who a few hours before had been the object of terror and execration, a confused murmur of applause rose from the crowd. They made way to let him pass; at the same time each one endeavoured to obtain a sight of him. When he arrived in front of the church, he took off his hat, and bowed his head in reverence, amidst the tumultuous din of many voices, which exclaiming “God bless you!” Don Abbondio took off his hat also, bent his head, and commended himself to the protection of heaven; and, hearing the voices of his brethren in the choir, he could not restrain his tears.

But when they reached the open country, in the windings of the almost deserted road, a darker veil came over his thoughts; there was nothing that he could regard with confidence but the driver, who, belonging to the establishment of the cardinal, must certainly be honest, and moreover did not look like a coward. From time to time they passed travellers crowding to see the cardinal. The sight of them was a transient balm to Don Abbondio; but still he approached this formidable valley, where they would meet none but the vassals of the Unknown! And what vassals! He desired more than ever to enter into conversation with his companion, to keep him in good humour; but, seeing him preoccupied, he dared not attempt to interrupt his thoughts. He was then obliged to hold colloquy with himself, of which we will transcribe a part for the benefit of the reader.

“Is it not an astonishing thing that the saints, as well as the wicked, have always quicksilver in their veins; and, not contented with making a bustle themselves, they would make all mankind, if they could, join the dance with them! Is there not a fatality in it, that the most troublesome come to me,—to me who never meddled with any body; they take me almost by the hair, and thrust me into their concerns! me! who desire nothing, but to live tranquilly, if they will let me do so. This mad knave Don Roderick. What was there wanting to make him the happiest man in the world, but a little prudence? He is rich, young, respected, courted; but happiness is a burthen to him, it seems; so that he must seek trouble for himself and his neighbour. He must set up, forsooth, for a molester of women,—the most silly, the most villanous, the most insane conduct in the world. He might ride to paradise in a coach; and he prefers to go halting to the devil's dwelling. And this man before me,” continued he, regarding him as if he feared he could hear his thoughts, “and this man, after having, by his villanies, turned the world upside down, now turns it upside down by his conversion—if he is really converted! Meanwhile, it is I who am to put it to the test! Some people always want to make a noise! Is it so difficult to act an honest part, all one's life, as I have? Not at all! but they prefer to murder, kill, and play the devil.—Oh! unhappy man that I am! they must always be in a bustle, even in doing penance! just as if one could not repent at home, in private, without so much noise,—without giving others so much trouble.—And his illustrious lordship! to receive him all at once with open arms; to call him his dear friend, his worthy friend; to listen to his least words as if he had seen him work miracles, to give him his public approbation to assist him in all his undertakings; I should call this precipitation! And without any pledge or security, to place a poor curate in his hands! A holy bishop—and he is such assuredly—a holy bishop should regard his curates as the apple of his eye. A little prudence, a little coolness, a little charity, are things which, in my opinion, are not inconsistent with sanctity. And should this be all hypocrisy? Who can tell the designs of such a man? To think that I must accompany him into the castle? There must be some deviltry in it! Am I not unhappy enough? Let me not think of it. But how has Lucy fallen into the clutches of this man? It is a secret between him and my lord the cardinal, and they don't deign to inform me concerning it: I don't care to meddle with the affairs of others, but when one's life is in danger one has a right to know something.—But poor Lucy—I shall be satisfied if she escapes. Heaven knows what she has suffered. I pity her, but she was born to be my ruin. And if this man is really converted, what need has he of me? Oh! what a chaos! But Heaven owes me its protection, since I did not get myself into the difficulty. If I could only read in the countenance of this man what passes in his soul! Look at him; now he looks like Saint Anthony in the desert, and now like Holofernes himself.”

In truth, the thoughts which agitated the Unknown passed over his countenance, as in a stormy day the clouds fly over the face of the sun, producing a succession of light and shade. His soul, calmed by the gentle language of Frederick, felt elated at the hope of mercy, pardon, and love; but then he sank again under the weight of the terrible past. Agitated and uneasy, he retraced in his memory those iniquities which were reparable, and considered what remedies would be the safest and quickest. And this unfortunate girl! how much she has suffered! how much he had caused her to suffer! At this thought his impatience to deliver her increased, and he made a sign to the coachman to hasten.

They entered at last into the valley. In what a situation was now our poor Don Abbondio! to find himself in this famous valley, of which he had heard such black and horrible tales. These famous men, the flower of the bravoes of Italy, these men without pity or fear, to see them in flesh and blood,—to meet them at every step! They bowed, it is true, respectfully, in the presence of their lord, but who knows what passed in their hearts, and what wicked design against the poor priest might, even then, be forming in their brains.

They reached Malanotte; bravoes were at the door, who bowed to the Unknown, glancing with eager curiosity at his companion, and the litter. If the departure of their master alone, at the break of day, had been regarded as extraordinary, his return was considered not less so. Is it a prize which he conducts? And how has he taken possession of it alone? And what is this strange litter? And whose is this livery? They did not stir, however; knowing, from the countenance of their master, that their silence was what he desired.

They reached the castle; the bravoes who were on the esplanade and at the door, retired on both sides to leave the passage free. The Unknown made a sign to them not to go farther off. Spurring his mule, he passed before the litter, and beckoning to Don Abbondio and the coachman to follow him, he entered a first court, and thence a second: approaching a small door, and with a gesture keeping back a bravo, who advanced to hold his stirrup, he said, “Remain there yourself, and let none approach nearer.” He dismounted, and with the reins in his hand, drew near the woman, who had withdrawn the curtains of the litter, saying to her in a low voice, “Hasten to comfort her; and make her understand at once that she is free, and with friends. God will reward you!” He then advanced to the curate, and helping him to dismount, said, “Signor Curate, I will not ask your forgiveness for the trouble you have taken on my account; you suffer for one who will reward you well, and for this poor girl.”

His countenance not less than his words restored the courage of Don Abbondio; drawing a full breath, which had been long pent up in his breast, he replied, “Your lordship jests, surely? But—but—” and accepting the hand offered to him so courteously, he slid from the saddle. The Unknown took the bridle, and gave both animals to the care of the driver, ordering him to wait there until their return. Taking a key from his pocket, he opened the little door, and followed by his two companions, the curate and the female, ascended the stairs.
CHAPTER XXIV.

Lucy had just risen. She was endeavouring to collect her senses, to separate the turbid visions of sleep from the remembrance of the sad reality, which appeared to her a dismal dream, when the old woman, in a voice which she meant to be humble and gentle, said to her, “Ah! you have slept! You would have done better to go to bed; I told you so a hundred times.” Receiving no answer, she continued, “Eat a little; you have need of something; if you do not, he will complain of me when he returns.”

“No, no, I wish to go to my mother. Your master promised me, he said, to-morrow morning. Where is he?”

“He has gone away; but he left word that he would return soon, and do all that you should desire.”

“Did he say so? did he say so? Well; I wish to go to my mother, now, now.”

Suddenly they heard steps in the adjoining chamber, and a knock at the door. The old woman demanded, “Who is there?”

“Open,” replied the well-known voice.

The old woman drew the bolt, and holding the door open, the Unknown let Don Abbondio and the good woman pass in; then closing the door, and remaining outside himself, he sent away the old woman to a distant part of the castle. The first appearance of other persons increased the agitation of Lucy, to whom any change brought an accession of alarm. She looked, and beholding a priest and a female, felt somewhat reassured; she looked again! Can it be? Recognising Don Abbondio, her eyes remained fixed as by the wand of an enchanter. The kind woman bent over her, and with an affectionate and anxious countenance, said, “Alas! my poor child! come, come with us.”

“Who are you?” said Lucy,—but, without waiting her reply, she turned again to Don Abbondio, exclaiming, “Is it you? Is it you indeed, Signor Curate? Where are we? Oh! unhappy girl! I am no longer in my right mind!”

“No, no, it is I, in truth; take courage. We have come to take you away. I am indeed your curate, come for this purpose——”

As if restored to strength in an instant, Lucy stood up, and fixing her eyes again on their faces, she said, “The Virgin has sent you, then!”

“I have no doubt of it,” said the good lady.

“But is it true, that we may go away? Is it true indeed?” resumed Lucy, lowering her voice to a timid and fearful tone. “And all these people,” continued she, with her lips compressed, and trembling from alarm and horror; “and this lord—this man—he promised me indeed.”

“He is here also in person with us,” said Don Abbondio. “He is without, expecting us; let us go at once; we must not make such a man wait.”

At this moment the Unknown appeared at the door. Lucy, who, a few moments before, had desired earnestly to see him—nay, having no other hope in the world, had desired to see none but him—now that she was so unexpectedly in the presence of friends, was, for a moment, overcome with terror. Shuddering with horror, she hid her face on the shoulder of the good dame. Beholding the innocent girl, on whom the evening before he had not had resolution to fix his eyes; beholding her countenance, pale, and changed, from fasting and prolonged suffering, the Unknown hesitated; but perceiving her impulse of terror, he cast down his eyes, and, after a moment's silence, exclaimed, “It is true! forgive me!”

“He comes to save you; he is not the same man; he has become good. Do you hear him ask your forgiveness?” whispered the dame in the ear of Lucy.

“Could any one say more? Come, lift up your head; do not play the child. We can go away now, immediately,” said Don Abbondio.

Lucy raised her head, looked at the Unknown, and beholding his humble and downcast expression, she was affected with a mingled feeling of gratitude and pity: “Oh! my lord! may God reward you for your compassion to an unfortunate girl!” cried she; “and may he recompense you a hundred-fold for the consolation you afford me by these words!” So saying, he advanced towards the door, and went out, followed by Lucy; who, quite encouraged, was supported by the arm of the good lady, Don Abbondio bringing up the rear. They descended the stairs, passed through the courts, and reached the litter; into which, the Unknown with almost timid politeness (a new thing for him!) assisted Lucy and her new companion to enter. He then aided Don Abbondio to reseat himself in the saddle. “Oh! what complaisance!” said the latter, moving much more lightly than he had done on first mounting.

The convoy resumed their way; as soon as the Unknown was mounted, his head was raised, and his countenance resumed its accustomed expression of command and authority. The robbers whom they met on their road discovered in it marks of strong thought and extraordinary solicitude; but they did not, they could not, comprehend the cause. They knew nothing as yet of the great change which had taken place in the soul of the man, and certainly such a conjecture would not have entered into their minds.

The good dame hastened to draw the curtains around the litter; pressing the hands of Lucy affectionately, she endeavoured to encourage her by words of piety, congratulation, and tenderness. Seeing, however, that besides the exhaustion from so much suffering, the confusion and obscurity of all that had happened prevented the poor girl from being alive to the satisfaction of her deliverance; she said what she thought would be most likely to restore her thoughts to their ordinary course. She mentioned the village to which she belonged, and towards which they were hastening.

“Yes, indeed!” said Lucy, remembering that this village was but a short distance from her own. “Oh! holy Virgin! I render thee thanks. My mother! my mother!”

“We will send for her immediately,” said her friend, not knowing that it had already been done.

“Yes, yes; God will reward you. And you,—who are you? How is it that you have come here?”

“Our curate sent me, because this lord, whose heart God has touched, (blessed be his holy name!) came to our village to see the cardinal archbishop, who is visiting among us, the dear man of God! This lord has repented of his horrible sins, and wishes to change his life; and he told the cardinal that he had carried off an innocent girl, with the connivance of another, whose name the curate did not mention to me.”

Lucy raised her eyes to heaven.

“You know it, perhaps,” continued the lady. “Well, the lord cardinal thought, that a young girl being in the question, a female should be found to accompany her; he told the curate to look for one, and the curate kindly came to me——”

“Oh! may God reward you for your goodness!”

“And the curate desired me to encourage you, my poor child, to relieve you from uneasiness at once, and to make you understand, how the Lord has miraculously preserved you.”

“Oh! miraculously indeed, through the intercession of the Virgin!”

“He told me to comfort you, to advise you to pardon him who has done you this evil, to rejoice that God has shown compassion towards him, and even to pray for him; for, besides its being a duty, you will derive comfort from it to your own heart.”

Lucy replied with a look which expressed assent as clearly as if she had made use of words, and with a sweetness which words could not have expressed.

“Worthy young woman!” resumed the friend. “And as your curate was also in our village, the lord cardinal judged it best to send him with us, thinking that he might be of some assistance. I had already heard that he was a poor sort of a timid man; and on this occasion, he has been wholly taken up with himself, like a hen with one chick.”

“And he——he who is thus changed——who is he?”

“How! do you not know?” said the good dame, repeating his name.

“Oh! merciful heaven!” cried Lucy. For many times had she heard this name repeated with horror, in more than one story, in which he had appeared like the Ogre of the fairy tale. At the idea of having been in his terrible power, and of now being under his protection,—at the thought of such peril, and such deliverance, in reflecting who this man was that had appeared to her so ferocious, and then so humble and so gentle, she was lost in astonishment, and could only exclaim, from time to time, “Oh! merciful Heaven!”

“Yes, it is indeed a great mercy! it is a great happiness for half the world in this neighbourhood, and afar off. When one thinks how many people he kept in continual alarm; and now, as our curate says——But you have only to look in his face to know that he is truly changed. And, besides, by ‘their works’ ye shall know them.”

We should not tell the truth, did we say that the good dame had no curiosity to learn more of an affair in which she played so important a part; but, to her praise it must be added, that, feeling a respectful pity for Lucy, and estimating the weight and dignity of the charge confided to her, she did not for a moment think of asking her an indiscreet or idle question. All her discourse in their short journey was composed of expressions of tenderness and interest for the poor girl.

“It must be long since you have eaten any thing.”

“I do not remember——It must indeed be some time.”

“Poor child! you must need something to restore your strength.”

“Yes,” replied Lucy, in a faint voice.

“At my house, thanks be to God, we shall find something presently. Be of good cheer, it is but a short distance off.”

Lucy, wearied and exhausted by her various emotions, fell languidly to the bottom of the litter, overcome by drowsiness; and her kind companion left her to a short repose.

As to Don Abbondio, the descent from the castle did not cause him so much fright as the ascent thither; but it was nevertheless not agreeable. When his alarm had first ceased, he felt relieved from an intolerable burthen; but he now began to torment himself in various ways, and found materials for such an operation in the present as well as in the future. His manner of travelling, to which he was not accustomed, he found to be exceedingly unpleasant, especially in the descent from the castle to the valley. The driver, obedient to a sign from the Unknown, made his beasts set off at a quick pace; the two mules kept up with the litter; and thus poor Don Abbondio, subjected to the unusual bounding and rebounding, which was more perilous from the steepness of the declivity they were descending, was obliged to hold fast by the saddle in order to keep his seat, not daring to ask his companions to abate somewhat of their speed. Moreover, if the road lay on a height, along a ridge, the mule, according to the custom of these animals, would obstinately keep on the outside, and place his feet literally on the very edge of the precipice. “Thou also,” said he in his heart to the beast, “thou also hath this cursed desire to seek danger, when there are so many other paths!” He tightened the rein on the other side, but in vain; so that, although dying of vexation and fear, he suffered himself, as was his custom, to be led by the will of another. The bravoes no longer caused him much uneasiness now that he felt confidence in their master. “But,” thought he, nevertheless, “if the news of this great conversion spreads, while we are yet here, who knows how these people may take it? Who knows what might be the result? Perhaps they might take it in their heads to think I had come as a missionary! and then (heaven preserve me!) they would make me suffer martyrdom!” But we have said enough of the terrors of Don Abbondio.

The company at last arrived at the extremity of the valley; the countenance of the Unknown became more serene, and Don Abbondio recovered in some degree his usual composure; but still his mind was occupied with more distant evils. “What will this fool Don Roderick say? To be exposed thus to scoffs and jests—how sorely will he feel it! he'll certainly play the devil outright! Perhaps he will seek another quarrel with me because I have been engaged in this cursed business! Having had the heart to send those two demons to attack me in the road, what he will do now, heaven knows. He cannot molest my lord the cardinal, because he is obviously beyond his reach; he will be obliged to champ the bit. However, the poison will be in his veins, and he will need to discharge it somewhere. It is well known how these affairs end; the blows always fall on the weakest. The cardinal will busy himself with placing Lucy in safety; this other poor devil is beyond his reach, but what is to become of me? And what will the cardinal do to defend me, after having engaged me in the business? Can he hinder this atrocious being from serving me a worse turn than before? And then he has so many things to think of! he cannot pay attention to every body! They who do good, do it in the gross, and enjoy their satisfaction without regarding minute consequences: but your evil-doer is more diligent; he lingers behind till he sees the last result, because of the fear that torments him. Shall I say I have acted by my lord archbishop's command, and against my own will? But it will seem that I favour villany! I—for the pleasure it gives me! Heaven forbid! but enough—I'll tell Perpetua the whole story, and leave her to circulate it—if indeed, his reverend lordship should not take up the fancy to make the whole matter public, and thrust me forward as a chief actor. However, I am determined on one thing: I will take leave of my lord the cardinal as soon as we arrive at the village, and go to my home. Lucy has no longer any need of me; she is under good protection; and, after so many fatigues, I may claim the right to take some repose.—But, should my lord be seized with the desire to know all her story, and I be compelled to relate the affair of the marriage! there would then be nothing wanting to complete my misery. And if he should visit my parish! Oh! let come what will, I will not torment myself beforehand! I have cares enough. For the present I shall shut myself up at home. But I foresee too well that my last days must be passed in trouble and vexation.”

The little troop arrived before the services of the church were over; and passing, as they had previously done, through the crowd, they proceeded to the house of Lucy's companion.

Hardly had Don Abbondio alighted from his mule, when, making the most profuse compliments to the Unknown, he begged him to apologise for him to the cardinal, as he was obliged to return directly to his parish on some urgent business. He then went in search of a staff that he had left in the hall, and which he was accustomed to call his horse, and proceeded homewards. The Unknown remained at the cardinal's house, awaiting his return from the church.

The good dame hastened to procure Lucy some refreshment to recruit her exhausted powers; she put some dry branches under a kettle which she replaced over the fire, and in which swam a good fowl; after having suffered it to boil a moment, she filled a plate with the soup, and offered it to Lucy, congratulating herself that the affair had happened on a day, when, as she said, “the cat was not on the hearth.” “It is a day of feasting for all the world,” added she, “except for those unfortunate creatures who can hardly obtain bread of vetches, and a polenta of millet; they hope, however, to receive something from our charitable cardinal. As for us, thank heaven, we are not in that situation; between the trade of my husband and a small piece of land, we manage to live comfortably. Eat, then, poor child, with a good appetite; the fowl will be done presently, and you shall have something better.” She then set about making preparations for dinner for the family.

As Lucy's spirits and strength returned, the necessity of arranging her dress occurred to her mind; she therefore tied up her long disordered tresses, and adjusted the handkerchief about her neck; in doing this, her fingers entwined themselves in the chaplet, which was there suspended: she gazed at it with much emotion, and the recollection of the vow she had made, this recollection which had been suspended by so many painful sensations, now rose clearly and distinctly to her mind. All the newly-awakened powers of her soul were again in a moment subdued. And if she had not been prepared for this by a life of innocence, resignation, and confidence, the consternation she experienced would have terminated in despair. After the first tumult of her thoughts had in some measure subsided, she exclaimed, “Oh! unhappy girl! what have I done!”

But hardly had she pronounced the words, when she was terrified at having done so; she recalled all the circumstances of her vow, her intolerable anguish, without hope of human aid, the fervour of her petition, the fulness of resolution with which the promise had been made; and to repent of this promise, after having obtained the favour she had implored, appeared to her sacrilegious ingratitude, perfidy towards God and the Virgin. It seemed to her that such infidelity would certainly draw upon her new and more terrible evils, and if these should indeed be its consequences she could no longer hope for an answer to her prayers; she therefore hastened to abjure her momentary regret, and drawing the chaplet reverently from her neck, and holding it in her trembling hand, she confirmed her vow; at the same time fervently praying to God that he would grant her strength to fulfil it, and to drive from her thoughts circumstances which might, if they did not move her resolution, still increase but too much the severity of the sacrifice. The absence of Renzo, without any probability of his return, which had at first been so bitter, appeared now to her a design of Providence, to make the two events conduce to the same end, and she endeavoured to find in one a consolation for the other. She also remembered that Providence would, to finish the work, find means to make Renzo resigned, and cause him to forget—— But scarcely had this idea entered her mind, when a new terror overwhelmed her. Conscious that her heart had still need of repentance, the unfortunate girl again had recourse to prayer, and mental conflict; and at length arose, if the expression may be allowed, like a victor wearied and wounded, having disarmed his enemy.

Suddenly footsteps and joyous exclamations were heard; they proceeded from the children of the family, who were returning from church. Two little girls and a little boy ran into the room; stopping a moment to eye the stranger, they then came to their mother, one asking the name of their unknown guest, another wanting to relate the wonders they had seen. The good dame replied to them all with “Be quiet; silence!” The master of the house then entered with a calmer step; but with joy diffused over his countenance. He was the tailor of the village and its environs; a man who knew how to read, and who had even read, more than once, the Legend of the Saints and the Reali di Francia; he was regarded by the peasants as a man of knowledge, and when they lavished their praises on him, he repelled them with much modesty, only saying that he had indeed mistaken his vocation, and that, perhaps, if he had studied——  Notwithstanding this little vanity he was the best natured man in the world. He had been present when the curate requested his wife to undertake her benevolent journey, and had not only given his approbation, but would have added his own persuasions, if that had been necessary; and now that the ceremonies of the church, and above all, the sermon of the cardinal, had given an impetus to his amiable feelings, he returned home with an ardent desire to know if the enterprise had succeeded, and to see the poor innocent girl in safety.

“See here!” said his wife to him as he entered, pointing to Lucy, who rose from her seat blushing, and stammering forth some apology. He advanced towards her, and, with a friendly tone, cried, “You are welcome! welcome! You bring the blessing of Heaven on this house! How glad I am to see you here! I knew that you would arrive safely to a haven, because I have never known the Lord commence a miracle without accomplishing it; but I am well content to see you here. Poor child! It is a great thing however to have been the subject of a miracle!”

We must not believe he was the only one who characterised the event by this term, and that because he had read the legendary. Throughout the village, and the surrounding country, it was spoken of in no other terms, as long as its remembrance lasted; and to say truth, if we regard its attendant circumstances, it would be difficult to find another name for it.

He then approached his wife, who was employed in taking the kettle from off the fire, and said in a low voice, “Has all gone well?”

“Very well. I will tell you another time.”

“Well, well, at your leisure.”

When the dinner was ready, the mistress of the house made Lucy sit down with them at the table, and helping her to a wing of the chicken, entreated her to eat. The husband began to dilate with much animation on the events of the day; not without many interruptions from the children, who stood round the table eating their dinner, and who had seen too many extraordinary things to be satisfied with playing the part of mere listeners. He described the solemn ceremonies, and then recurred to the miraculous conversion; but that which had made the most impression on his mind, and of which he spoke the oftenest, was the sermon of the cardinal.

“To see him before the altar,” said he, “a lord like him, to see him before the altar, as a simple curate——”

“And that golden thing he had on his head,” said one of the little girls.

“Hush, be quiet. When one thinks, I say, that a lord like him, a man so learned, who, as they say, has read all the books in the world, a thing which no one else has done, not even in Milan; when one thinks that he has adapted himself so to the comprehension of others, that every one understood him——”

“I understood, I did,” said the other little chatterer.

“Hush, be quiet. What did you understand, you?”

“I understood that he explained the Gospel, instead of the curate.”

“Be quiet. I do not say that he was understood by those only who know something, but even those who were the most stupid and ignorant, caught the sense perfectly. You might go now, and ask them to repeat his discourse; perhaps they might not remember a single word, but they would have its whole meaning in their head. And how easy it was to perceive that he alluded to this signor, although he never pronounced his name! But one might have guessed it from the tears which flowed from his eyes. And all the people wept——”

“That is true,” cried the little boy. “But why did they all cry like little children?”

“Be quiet. And there are, nevertheless, hard hearts in this country. He has made us feel that although there is a scarcity, we must return thanks to God, and be satisfied; be industrious; do what we can, and then be content, because unhappiness does not consist at all in suffering and poverty; unhappiness is the result of wicked actions. These are not fine words merely; it is well known that he lives like a poor man, that he takes the bread from his mouth to give to those that are in need, when he might live an easier life than any one. Oh, then, there is great satisfaction in hearing him speak. He is not like many others, who say, ‘Do as I say, and not as I do;’ and besides, he has made it very apparent, that those even who are not what they call gentlemen, but who have more than is necessary, are bound to impart to those who are in want.”

And here he stopped, as if pained by some recollection; after a moment's silence, he filled a plate with meat from the table, and adding a loaf of bread to it, tied up the whole in a napkin. “Take that,” said he to the oldest of the children, and putting in her other hand a bottle of wine, “carry that to the widow Martha, and tell her to feast with her children. But be very careful what you say to her, don't seem to be doing a charity, and don't say a word of it, should you meet any one; and take care not to break any thing.”

Lucy was touched, even to tears, and her soul was filled with a tenderness that withdrew her from the contemplation of her own sorrows. The conversation of this worthy man had already imparted a relief, that a direct appeal to her feelings would have failed to procure. Her spirit, yielding to the charm of the description of the august pomp of the church, of the emotions of piety there excited, and partaking of the enthusiasm of the narrator, forgot its woes, and, when obliged to recur to them, felt itself strengthened. The thought even of the great sacrifice she had imposed on herself, without having lost its bitterness, had assumed the character of austere and solemn tranquillity.

A few moments after, the curate of the village entered, saying that he was sent by the cardinal for intelligence concerning Lucy, and also to inform her that he desired to see her that day; then he thanked, in his lordship's name, her kind hosts for their benevolence and hospitality. All three, moved to tears, could not find words to reply to such a message from such a person.

“Has your mother not yet arrived?” said the curate to Lucy.

“My mother!” cried she.

Learning that the good archbishop had sent for her mother, that it was his own kind thought, her heart was overpowered, she raised her apron to her eyes, and her tears continued to flow long after the departure of the curate. As these tumultuous emotions, called forth by such unexpected benevolence, gradually subsided, the poor girl remembered that she had expressly solicited this very happiness of again beholding her mother, as a condition to her vow. “Return me safely to my mother.” These words recurred distinctly to her memory. She was confirmed more than ever in her purpose to keep her vow, and repented again bitterly of the regret which she had for a moment experienced.

Agnes, indeed, even whilst they were speaking of her, was very near; it is easy to imagine the feelings of the poor woman at so unexpected an invitation, at the intelligence, necessarily confused and incomplete, of a peril which was passed, but of a frightful peril, of an obscure adventure, of which the messenger knew not the circumstances, and could give no explanation, and for which she could find no clue from previous facts. “Ah, great God! ah, holy Virgin!” escaped from her lips, mingled with useless questions, during the journey. On the road she met Don Abbondio, who, by the aid of his staff, was travelling homewards. Uttering an exclamation of surprise, Agnes made the driver stop. She alighted, and with the curate withdrew into a grove of chestnuts, which was on the side of the road. Don Abbondio informed her of all he had seen and known: much obscurity still rested upon his statement, but at least Agnes ascertained that Lucy was now in safety.

Don Abbondio then introduced another subject of conversation, and would have given her ample instruction on the manner of conducting herself with the archbishop, if he, as was probable, should wish to see her and her daughter. He said it would not answer for her to speak of the marriage; but Agnes, perceiving that he spoke only from his own interest, was determined to promise nothing, because she said, “she had other things to think of,” and bidding him farewell, she proceeded on her journey.

The carriage at last reached the house of the tailor, and the mother and daughter were folded in each other's arms. The good wife, who was the only witness of the scene, endeavoured to soothe and calm their feelings; and then prudently left them alone, saying that she would go and prepare a bed for them.

Their first tumultuous joy having in some measure subsided, Agnes requested to hear the adventures of Lucy, who attempted to relate them; but the reader knows that it was a history with which no one was entirely acquainted, and to Lucy herself there was much that was inexplicable, particularly the fatal coincidence of the carriage being at that place precisely at the moment that Lucy had gone there by an extraordinary chance. With regard to this, the mother and daughter lost themselves in conjecture, without even approaching the real cause. As to the principal author of this plot, however, they neither of them doubted that it was Don Roderick.

“Ah, that firebrand!” cried Agnes; “but his hour will come. God will reward him according to his works, and then he will know——”

“No, no, mother, no!” cried Lucy. “Do not wish harm to him! do not wish it to any one! If you knew what it is to suffer! if you had experienced it! No, no! rather let us pray to God and the Virgin for him, that God would touch his heart as he has done that of the other lord, who was worse than he, and who is now a saint.”

The horror that Lucy felt in retracing events so painful and recent made her hesitate more than once. More than once she said she had not the heart to proceed, and, choked by her tears, she with difficulty went on with her narrative. But she was embarrassed by a different sentiment at a certain point of her recital, at the moment when she was about to speak of her vow. She feared her mother would accuse her of imprudence and precipitation; she feared that she would, as she had done in the affair of the marriage, bring forward her broad rules of conscience, and make them prevail; she feared that the poor woman would tell it to some one in confidence, if it were only to gain light and advice, and thus render it public. These reflections made Lucy experience insupportable shame, and an inexplicable repugnance to speak on the subject. She therefore passed over in silence this important circumstance, determining in her heart to communicate it first to Father Christopher; but how great was her sorrow at learning that he was no longer at the convent, that he had been sent to a distant country, a country called——

“And Renzo?” enquired Agnes.

“He is in safety, is he not?” said Lucy, hastily.

“It must be so, since every one says so. They say that he has certainly gone to Bergamo, but no one knows the place exactly, and there has been no intelligence from himself. He probably has not been able to find the means of informing us.”

“Oh, if he is in safety, God be thanked!” said Lucy, commencing another subject of conversation, which was, however, interrupted by an unexpected event—the arrival of the cardinal archbishop.

After having returned from the church, and having learnt from the Unknown the arrival of Lucy, he had seated himself at table, placing the Unknown on his right hand; the company was composed of a number of priests, who gazed earnestly at the countenance of their once formidable companion, so softened without weakness, so humbled without meanness, and compared it with the horrible idea they had so long entertained of him.

Dinner being over, the Unknown and the cardinal retired together. After a long interview, the former departed for his castle, and the latter sent for the curate of the parish, and requested him to conduct him to the house where Lucy had received an asylum.

“Oh, my lord,” replied the curate, “suffer me, suffer me. I will send for the young girl and her mother, if she has arrived,—the hosts themselves, if my lord desires it.”

“I wish to go to them myself,” replied Frederick.

“There is no necessity that you should inconvenience yourself; I will send for them immediately,” insisted the curate, who did not understand that, by this visit, the cardinal wished to do honour to misfortune, innocence, hospitality, and to his own ministry. But the superior repeating his desire, the inferior bowed, and they proceeded on their way.

When they appeared in the street, a crowd immediately collected around them. The curate cried, “Come, come, back, keep off.”—“But,” said Frederick, “suffer them,” and he advanced, now raising his hands to bless the people, now lowering them to embrace the children, who obstructed his progress. They reached the house, and entered it, whilst the crowd remained without. But amidst the throng was the tailor, who had followed with others; his eyes fixed, and his mouth open, wondering where the cardinal was going. When he beheld him entering his own house, he bustled his way through the crowd, crying out, “Make room for those who have a right to enter,” and followed into the house.

Agnes and Lucy heard an increasing murmur in the street; and whilst they were surmising the cause, the door opened, and, behold, the cardinal and the curate!

“Is this she?” asked the former of the curate, and at a sign in the affirmative he approached Lucy, who with her mother was standing, motionless and mute with surprise and extreme diffidence: but the tones of the voice, the countenance, and above all, the words of Frederick, soon removed their embarrassment. “Poor young woman,” said he, “God has permitted you to be subjected to a great trial; but he has also made you see that he watches over you, and has never forgotten you. He has saved you, and in addition to that blessing, has made use of you to accomplish a great work through you, to impart the wonders of his grace and mercy to one man, and at the same time to comfort the hearts of many.”

Here the mistress of the house entered the room with her husband: perceiving their guests engaged in conversation, they respectfully retired to a distant part of the apartment. The cardinal bowed to them courteously, and continued the conversation with Lucy and her mother. He mixed with the consolation he offered many enquiries, hoping to find from their answers some way of rendering them still farther services after their sufferings.

“It is a pity all the clergy were not like your lordship, and then they would take the part of the poor, and not help to bring them into difficulty for the sake of drawing themselves out of it,” said Agnes, encouraged by the familiar and affable manner of Frederick, and vexed that Don Abbondio, after having sacrificed others to his own selfishness, should dare to forbid her making the least complaint to one so much above him, when by so fortunate a chance the occasion presented itself.

“Say all that you think,” said the cardinal; “speak freely.”

“I would say, that if our curate had done his duty, things would not have been as they are.”

The cardinal begging her to explain herself more clearly, she found some embarrassment in relating a history, in which she had at one time played a part, which she felt very unwilling to communicate to such a man. However, she got over the difficulty; she related the projected marriage, the refusal of Don Abbondio, and the pretext he had offered with respect to his superiors (oh, Agnes!); and passing to the attempt of Don Roderick, she told in what manner, being informed of it, they had been able to escape. “But, indeed,” added she in conclusion, “it was escaping to fall into another snare. If the curate had told us sincerely the difficulty, and had married my poor children, we would have left the country immediately, and gone where no one would have known us, not even the wind. Thus time was lost, and that which has happened, has happened.”

“The curate shall render me an account of this,” said the cardinal.

“No, my lord, no,” resumed Agnes. “I did not speak on that account, do not reprove him; because what is done, is done; and it would answer no purpose. He is a man of such a character, that if the thing were to do over again, he would act precisely in the same way.”

But Lucy, dissatisfied with this manner of telling the story, added, “We have also been to blame; it is plain that it was the will of God the thing should not succeed.”

“How can you have been to blame, my poor child?” said Frederick.

Lucy, notwithstanding the winks of her mother, related in her turn the history of the attempt made in the house of Don Abbondio, saying, as she concluded, “We did wrong, and God has punished us.”

“Accept from his hand the chastisement you have endured, and take courage,” said Frederick; “for who has a right to rejoice and hope, if not those who have suffered, and who accuse themselves?”

He then asked where was the betrothed; and learning from Agnes (Lucy stood silent with downcast eyes) the fact of his flight, he expressed astonishment and displeasure, and asked the reason of it. Agnes told what she knew of the story of Renzo.

“I have heard of him before,” said the cardinal; “but how could a man, who was engaged in affairs of this nature, be in treaty of marriage with this young girl?”

“He was a worthy young man,” said Lucy, blushing, but in a firm voice.

“He was a peaceable youth, too peaceable, perhaps,” added Agnes; “your lordship may ask any one if he was not, even the curate. Who knows what intrigues and plots may have been going on at Milan? There needs little to make poor people pass for rogues.”

“That is but too true,” said the cardinal; “I will enquire about him, without doubt.” He took a memorandum of the name of the young man, adding that he expected to be at their village in a few days; that during his sojourn there, Lucy could return home without fear, and in the mean while he would procure her an asylum till all was arranged for the best.

Turning to the master and mistress of the house, they came forward; he renewed the thanks he had addressed to them by the mouth of the curate, and asked them if they would be willing to keep the guests God had sent them for a few days.

“Oh yes, my lord,” replied the dame, with a manner which said more than this timid reply; but her husband, quite animated by the presence of such a man, by the desire to do himself honour on an occasion of such importance, studied to make a fine answer. He wrinkled his forehead, strained his eyes, and compressed his mouth, but nevertheless felt a confusion of ideas, which prevented him from uttering a syllable. But time pressed; the cardinal appeared to have interpreted his silence. The poor man opened his mouth, and said, “Imagine——” Not a word more could he say. His failure not only filled him with shame on that day, but ever after, the unfortunate recollection intruded itself to mar the pleasure of the great honour he had received. How many times, in thinking of this circumstance, did a crowd of words come to his mind, every one of which would have been better than “Imagine!” But the cavities of our brains are full enough of thoughts when it is too late to employ them.

The cardinal departed, saying, “May the blessing of Heaven rest on this house!”

That evening he asked the curate in what way it would be best to indemnify the tailor, who could not be rich, for his hospitality. The curate replied, that truly neither the profits of his trade, nor his income from some little fields that the good tailor possessed, would at this time have enabled him to be liberal to others; but from having saved something the few years previous, he was one of the most easy in circumstances in the district; that he could allow himself to exercise some hospitality without inconvenience, and that he would do it with pleasure; and that he was confident he would be hurt if money was offered to him.

“He has probably,” said the cardinal, “some demands on people who are unable to pay.”

“You may judge, my lord; the poor people pay with the overplus of the harvest; this year there has been no overplus; on the contrary, every one is behind in point even of necessities.”

“Well, I take upon myself all these debts. You will do me the favour to obtain from him the memoranda, and cancel them.”

“It may be a very large sum.”

“So much the better. And perhaps you have but too many who are more miserable, having no debts, because they have no credit?”

“Oh yes! indeed too many! they do what they can; but how can they supply their wants in these hard times?”

“Have them clothed at my expense; it is true that it seems to be robbery to spend any thing this year, except for bread; but this is a particular case.”

We cannot finish our record of the history of this day without briefly relating the conduct of the Unknown. Before his second return to the castle, the report of his conversion had preceded him; it had spread through the valley, and excited surprise, anxiety, and numerous conjectures. As he approached the castle he made a sign to all the bravoes he met to follow him: filled with unusual apprehension, but with their accustomed submission, they obeyed; their number increased every moment. Reaching the castle, he entered the first court, and there, resting on his saddle bow, in a voice of thunder he gave a loud call, the wonted signal which all habitually obeyed. In a moment those who were scattered about the castle hastened to join the troop collected around their leader.

“Go and wait for me in the great hall,” said he; as they departed, he dismounted from his beast, and leading it himself to the stable, thence approached the hall. The whispering which was heard among them ceased at his appearance; retiring to one corner they left a large space around him.

The Unknown raised his hand to enforce the silence that his presence alone had already effected; then raising his head, which yet was above that of any of his followers, he said, “Listen to me, all of you; and let no one speak, unless I ask him a question. My friends, the way which we have followed until to-day leads to hell. I do not wish to reproach you, I could not effect the important change, inasmuch as I have been your leader in our abominable career; I have been the most guilty of all; but listen to what I am about to say.

“God in his mercy has called me to a change of life, and I have obeyed his call. May this same God do as much for you! Know, then, and hold for certain, that I would rather now die than undertake any thing against his holy law. I recall all the iniquitous orders which I may have given any one of you; you understand me. And farther, I order you to do nothing which I have hitherto prescribed to you. Hold equally for certain, that no one can hereafter commit evil under my protection, and in my service. Those who will remain with me on these conditions, I shall regard as children. I should be happy, in the day of famine, to share with them the last mouthful that remained to me. To those who do not wish to continue here, shall be paid what is due of their salaries, and a further donative; they have liberty to depart, but they must never return, unless they repent and intend to lead a new life, and under such circumstances they shall be received with open arms. Think of it this night; to-morrow morning I will receive your answer, and then I will give you your orders. Now, every one to his post. May God, who has shown compassion towards me, incline your hearts to repentance and good dispositions.”

He ceased, and all kept silence. Although strange and tumultuous thoughts fermented in their minds, no indication of them was visible. They had been habituated to listen to the voice of their lord, as to a manifestation of absolute authority, to which it was necessary to yield implicit obedience. His will proclaimed itself changed, but not enfeebled: it did not therefore enter their minds, that because he was converted they might become bold in his presence, or reply to him as they would to another man. They regarded him as a saint, indeed, but a saint sword in hand.

In addition to the fear with which he inspired them, they felt for him (especially those who were born in his service, and these were the greater number) the affection of vassals. Their admiration partook of the nature of love, mingled with that respect which the most rebellious and turbulent spirits feel for a superior, whom they have voluntarily recognised as such. The sentiments he expressed were certainly hateful to their ears, but they knew they were not false, neither were they entirely strange to them. If their custom had been to make them subjects of pleasantry, it was not from disbelief of their verity, but to drive away, by jesting, the apprehensions the contemplation of them might otherwise have excited. And now, there was none among them who did not feel some compunction at beholding their power exerted over the invincible courage of their master. Moreover, some of them had heard the extraordinary intelligence beyond the valley, and had witnessed and related the joy of the people, the new feeling with which the Unknown was regarded by them, the veneration which had succeeded their former hatred—their former terror. They beheld the man whom they had never regarded without trembling, even when they themselves constituted, to a great degree, his strength; they beheld him now, the wonder, the idol of the multitude,—still elevated above all others, in a different manner, no doubt, but in one not less imposing,—always above the world, always the first. They were confounded, and each was doubtful of the course he should pursue. One reflected hastily where he could find an asylum and employment; another questioned with himself his power to accommodate himself to the life of an honest man; another, moved by what he had said, felt some inclination for it; and another still was willing to promise any thing so as to be entitled to the share of a loaf, which had been so cordially proffered, and which was so scarce in those days. No one, however, broke the silence. The Unknown, at the conclusion of his speech, waved his hand imperiously for them to retire: obedient as a flock of sheep, they all quietly left the hall. He followed them, and stopping in the centre of the court, saw them all branch off to their different stations. He returned into the castle, visited the corridors, halls, and every avenue, and, finding all quiet, he retired to sleep,—yes, to sleep, for he was very sleepy. In spite of all the urgent and intricate affairs in which he was involved, more than at any former conjuncture, he was sleepy. Remorse had banished sleep the night before; its voice, so far from being subdued, was still more absolute—was louder—yet he was sleepy. The order of his household so long established, the absolute devotion of his faithful followers, his power and means of exercising it, its various ramifications, and the objects on which it was employed, all tended to create uncertainty and confusion in his mind,—still he was sleepy.

To his bed then he went, that bed which the night before had been a bed of thorns; but first he knelt to pray. He sought, in the remotest corner of his memory, the words of prayer taught him in his days of childhood. They came one by one: an age of vice had not effaced them. And who shall define the sentiments that pervaded his soul at this return to the habits of happy innocence? He slept soundly.
CHAPTER XXV.

The next morning, in the village of Lucy, and throughout all the territory of Lecco, nothing was talked of but herself, the Unknown, the archbishop, and another person, who, although generally desirous to be talked of, would willingly have been forgotten on this occasion,—we mean Don Roderick.

Not that, previous to this period, the villagers had not conversed much of his actions, in secret, to those in whom they had perfect confidence; but now they could no longer contain themselves, nor surpress many enquiries on the marvellous events in which two persons so famous had played a part. In comparison of these two personages, Signor Don Roderick appeared rather insignificant, and all agreed in rejoicing over the ill success of his iniquitous designs; but these rejoicings were still, in some measure, moderated by fears of the bravoes by whom he was surrounded.

A good portion of the public censure was bestowed on his friends and courtiers. It did not spare the Signor Podestà, always deaf and dumb and blind to the deeds of this tyrant, but these opinions were expressed in an under-tone, because the Podestà had his officers. Such regard was not paid to Doctor Azzecca Garbugli, who had only his tricks and his verbiage to employ for his defence; and as to the whole tribe of sycophants, resembling him, they were so pointed at, and eyed askance, that for some time they thought it most prudent to keep themselves within doors.

Don Roderick, struck, as by a thunderbolt, with the unexpected intelligence, so different from that which he had been anticipating from day to day, kept himself shut up in his castle, alone with his bravoes, devouring his rage for the space of two days, and on the third set off for Milan. If there had only existed the murmurs of the people, notwithstanding things had gone so far, he would perhaps have remained expressly to brave them; but he felt himself compelled to quit the field of contest, by the certain information that the cardinal was coming to the village. The count, his uncle, who knew nothing of the story but what Attilio had told him, would certainly require him to be one of the first to visit the cardinal, in order to obtain in public the most distinguished reception from him. The count would require it, because it was an important opportunity for making known in what esteem the house was held by his powerful eminence. To escape such a dilemma, Don Roderick, having risen before the sun, threw himself into a carriage with Griso, and, followed by the rest of the bravoes, retired like a fugitive, like (if we may be permitted to elevate him by such a comparison), like Catiline from Rome, foaming with rage, and threatening a speedy return to accomplish his revenge.

Meanwhile the cardinal approached, visiting every day one of the parishes situated in the territory of Lecco. On the day he was expected in the village, great preparations were made for his reception. At the entrance of the village, near the cottage of Agnes, a triumphal arch was erected, constructed of wood, covered with moss and straw, and ornamented with green boughs of birch and holly. The front of the church was adorned with tapestry; from every window of the houses were suspended quilts and sheets, intended for drapery; every thing, in short, whether in good taste or bad, was displayed in honour of this extraordinary occasion. At the hour of vespers (which was the hour Frederick usually selected to arrive at the churches which he visited), those who had not gone to church, the old men, women, and the youngest of the children, went forth, in procession, to meet their expected guest, headed by Don Abbondio. The poor curate was sad in the midst of the public joy; the tumult bewildered him; the movement of so many people, before and behind, disturbed him; and, moreover, he was tormented by the secret apprehension that the women had tattled, and that he should be obliged to render an account of his conduct to the cardinal.

Frederick appeared at last, or rather the crowd appeared, in the midst of which was his litter, and the retinue surrounding it. The persons who followed Don Abbondio scattered and mingled themselves with the crowd, notwithstanding all his remonstrances; and he, poor man, finding himself deserted by them, went to the church, there to await the cardinal's approach.

The cardinal advanced, bestowing benedictions with his hands, and receiving them in return from the mouths of the people, who were with difficulty kept back by his attendants. Being of the same village as Lucy, these peasants were desirous of rendering to the archbishop peculiar demonstrations of respect, but this was not practicable, inasmuch as, wherever he went, he was received with every possible honour. In the very commencement of his pontificate, at his first solemn entrance into the cathedral, the concourse had been so great that his life was in peril. Some gentlemen, who were near him, drew their swords to keep back and alarm the crowd. Such was the rude violence of the times, that even in the general disposition to do honour to their archbishop, they were on the point of crushing him: and this defence would not have been sufficient, if two priests, of great vigour and presence of mind, had not raised him in their arms, and carried him from the church door to the foot of the great altar. His very first entrance into the church, therefore, might be recorded amidst his pastoral labours and the dangers he had run.

Entering the church, the cardinal advanced to the altar, and after having prayed some time, he addressed, as was his custom, some words to the people, on his love for them, on his desire for their salvation, and how they should dispose their minds for the duties of the morrow. He then withdrew to the house of the curate, and among other questions which he put to him, he interrogated him with regard to the character and conduct of Renzo. Don Abbondio replied that he was rather choleric and obstinate: but as the cardinal made more special and precise enquiries, he was obliged to confess that he was an honest peaceable youth, and even he himself could not comprehend how he had committed at Milan the conduct which had been imputed to him.

“As to the young girl,” continued the cardinal, “do you think she can return now with safety to her house?”

“At present,” replied Don Abbondio, “she can come and remain for a while. I say, at present, but,” added he with a sigh, “your illustrious lordship should be always near at hand.”

“God is always present,” said the cardinal. “But I will use my efforts to secure a place of safety for her.”

Before dismissing Don Abbondio, he ordered him to send a litter, on the following day, for Lucy and her mother.

Don Abbondio went away quite pleased that the cardinal had talked to him of the young couple, without even alluding to his refusal to marry them. “He knows nothing of it,” said he; “Agnes has kept silence! wonderful! She will see him again, 'tis true, but she shall have further instructions from me, so she shall.” He little thought, poor man, that Frederick had only deferred the enquiry until he should have more leisure to learn the reasons of his conduct.

But the solicitude of the good prelate for the disposal of Lucy had been rendered useless, by a circumstance which we will relate.

The two females had as far as possible resumed, for the few days they had to pass under the hospitable roof of the tailor, their usual manner of life. As she had done at the monastery, Lucy, in a small chamber apart, employed herself in sewing; and Agnes, keeping much at home, remained for the most part with her daughter. Their conversations were affectionate and sorrowful; both were prepared for a separation, since the sheep could not dwell in the neighbourhood of the wolf. But how long was this separation to continue? The future was dark and inexplicable, but Agnes, notwithstanding, was full of agreeable anticipation. “After all,” said she, “if no irreparable misfortune has befallen Renzo, we shall soon hear from him. If he has found employment, (and who can doubt it?) and if he keeps the faith he has sworn to you, why cannot we go and live with him?” Her daughter felt as much sorrow in listening to her hopes, as difficulty in replying to them. She still kept her secret in her heart; and although troubled at the idea of concealment with so good a mother, she was nevertheless restrained by a thousand fears from communicating it. Her plans were, indeed, very different from those of her mother, or rather, she had none, having committed the future into the hands of Providence; she therefore endeavoured to change the subject, saying in general terms that her only hope was to be permanently re-united to her mother.

“Do you know why you feel thus?” said Agnes; “you have suffered so much, that it seems impossible to you that things can turn out happily. But let God work; and if——  Let a ray of hope come—a single ray, and then we shall see that you will think differently.”

Lucy and her mother entertained a lively friendship for their kind hosts, which was warmly reciprocated; and between whom can friendship exist more in its purity, than between the benefactor and the recipients of the benefit, when both have kind hearts! Agnes, especially, had long gossips with the mistress of the house, and the tailor afforded them much amusement by his tales and moral discourses; at dinner particularly he had always something to relate of the sword of Roland, or of the Fathers of the Thebaid.

At some miles' distance from the village there dwelt a certain Don Ferrante, and Donna Prassede his wife; the latter was a woman of high birth, somewhat advanced in age, and exceedingly inclined to do good; which is surely the most praiseworthy employment one can be engaged on in this world; but which, indulged in without judgment, may be rendered hurtful, like all other good things. To do good, we must have correct ideas of good in itself considered, and this can be acquired only by control over our own hearts. Donna Prassede governed herself with her ideas, as some do with their friends; she had very few, but to these she was much attached. Among these few, were a number unfortunately a little narrow and unreasonable, and they were not those she loved the least. Thence it happened that she regarded things as good, which were not really so, and that she used means which were calculated to promote the very opposite of that which she intended; to this perversion of her intellect may also be attributed the fact, that she esteemed all measures to be lawful to her who was bent on the performance of duty. In short, with good intentions, her moral perceptions were in no small degree distorted. Hearing the wonderful story of Lucy, she was seized with a desire to know her, and immediately sent her carriage for the mother and daughter. Lucy, having no desire to go, requested the tailor to find some excuse for her; if they had been common people, who desired to make her acquaintance, the tailor would willingly have rendered her the service, but, under such circumstances, refusal appeared to him a species of insult. He uttered so many exclamations, such as, that it was not customary—that it was a high family—that it was out of the question to say No to such people—that it might make their fortune—and that, in addition to all this, Donna Prassede was a saint,—that Lucy was finally obliged to yield, especially as Agnes seconded the remonstrances and arguments of the tailor.

The high-born dame received them with many congratulations; she questioned and advised them with an air of conscious superiority, which was, however, tempered by so many soft and humble expressions, and mingled with so much zeal and devotion, that Agnes and Lucy soon felt themselves relieved from the painful restraint her mere presence had at first imposed on them. In brief, Donna Prassede, learning that the cardinal wished to procure an asylum for Lucy, and impelled by the desire to second, and at the same time to anticipate, his good intention, offered to take the young girl to her house, where there would be no other service required of her than to direct the labours of the needle or the spindle. She added, that she herself would inform the cardinal of the arrangement.

Besides the obvious and ordinary benefit conferred by her invitation, Donna Prassede proposed to herself another, which she deemed to be peculiarly important; this was to school impatience, and to place in the right path a young creature who had much need of guidance. The first time she heard Lucy spoken of, she was immediately persuaded that in one so young, who had betrothed herself to a robber, a criminal, a fugitive from justice such as Renzo, there must be some corruption, some concealed vice. “Tell me what company you keep, and I will tell you who you are.” The visit of Lucy had confirmed her opinion; she appeared, indeed, to be an artless girl, but who could tell the cause of her downcast looks and timid replies? There was no great effort of mind necessary to perceive that the maiden had opinions of her own. Her blushes, sighs, and particularly her large and beautiful eyes, did not please Donna Prassede at all. She regarded it as certain as if she had been told it by having authority, that the misfortunes of Lucy were a punishment from Heaven for her connection with that villain, and a warning to withdraw herself from him entirely. That settled the determination to lend her co-operation to further so desirable a work; for as she frequently said to herself and others, “Was it not her constant study to second the will of Heaven?” But, alas! she often fell into the terrible mistake of taking for the will of Heaven, the vain imaginings of her own brain. However, she was on the present occasion very careful not to exhibit any of her proposed intentions. It was one of her maxims, that the first rule to be observed in accomplishing a good design, is to keep your motives to yourself.

Excepting the painful necessity of separation the offer appeared to both mother and daughter very inviting, were it only on account of the short distance from the castle to their village. Reading in each other's countenance their mutual assent, they accepted with many thanks the kindness of Donna Prassede, who renewing her kind promises, said she would soon send them a letter to present to the cardinal. The two females having departed, she requested Don Ferrante to write a letter, who, being a literary and learned man, was employed as her secretary on occasions of importance. In an affair of this sort, Don Ferrante did his best, and he gave the original to his wife in order that she could copy it; he warmly recommended to her an attention to the orthography, as orthography was among the great number of things he had studied, and among the small number over which he had control in his family. The letter was forthwith copied and sent to the tailor's house. These events occurred a few days before the cardinal had despatched a litter to bring the mother and daughter to their abode.

Upon their arrival they went to the parsonage; orders having been left for their immediate admittance to the presence of the cardinal. The chaplain, who conducted them thither, gave them many instructions with regard to the ceremony to be used with him, and the titles to be given him; it was a continual torment to the poor man to behold the little ceremony that reigned around the good archbishop in this respect. “This results,” he was accustomed to say, “from the excessive goodness of this blessed man—from his great familiarity.” And he added that he had “even heard people address him with Yes, sir, and No, sir!”

At this moment, the cardinal was conversing with Don Abbondio on the affairs of his parish; so that the latter had no opportunity to repeat his instructions to the females; however, in passing by them as they entered, he gave them a glance, to make them comprehend that he was well satisfied with them, and that they should continue, like honest and worthy women, to keep silence.

After the first reception, Agnes drew from her bosom the letter of Donna Prassede, and gave it to the cardinal, saying, “It is from the Signora Donna Prassede, who says that she knows your illustrious lordship well, my lord, as naturally is the case with great people. When you have read, you will see.”

“It is well,” said Frederick, after having read the letter, and extracted its meaning from the trash of Don Ferrante's flowers of rhetoric. He knew the family well enough to be certain that Lucy had been invited into it with good intentions, and that she would be sheltered from the snares and violence of her persecutor. As to his opinion of Donna Prassede, we do not know it precisely; probably she was not a person he would have chosen for Lucy's protectress; but it was not his habit to undo things, apparently ordered by Providence, in order to do them better.

“Submit, without regret, to this separation also, and to the suspense in which you are left,” said he. “Hope for the best, and confide in God! and be persuaded, that all that He sends you, whether of joy or sorrow, will be for your permanent good.” Having received the benediction which he bestowed on them, they took their leave.

Hardly had they reached the street, when they were surrounded by a swarm of friends, who were expecting them, and who conducted them in triumph to their house. Their female acquaintances congratulated them, sympathised with them, and overwhelmed them with enquiries. Learning that Lucy was to depart on the following morning, they broke forth in exclamations of regret and disappointment. The men disputed with each other the privilege of offering their services; each wished to remain for the night to guard their cottage, which reminds us of a proverb; “If you would have people willing to confer favours on you, be sure not to need them.” This warmth of reception served a little to withdraw Lucy from the painful recollections which crowded upon her mind, at the sight of her loved home.

At the sound of the bell which announced the commencement of the ceremonies, all moved towards the church. The ceremonies over, Don Abbondio, who had hastened home to see every thing arranged for breakfast, was told that the cardinal wished to speak with him. He proceeded to the chamber of his illustrious guest, who accosted him as he entered, with “Signor Curate, why did you not unite in marriage, Lucy to her betrothed?”

“They have emptied the sack this morning,” thought Don Abbondio, and he stammered forth, “Your illustrious lordship has no doubt heard of all the difficulties of that business. It has been such an intricate affair, that it cannot even now be seen into clearly. Your illustrious lordship knows that the young girl is here, only by a miracle; and that no one can tell where the young man is.”

“I ask if it is true, that, before these unhappy events, you refused to celebrate the marriage on the day agreed upon? and why you did so?”

“Truly—if your illustrious lordship knew—what terrible orders I received—” and he stopped, indicating by his manner, though respectfully, that it would be imprudent in the cardinal to enquire farther.

“But,” said Frederick, in a tone of much more gravity than he was accustomed to employ, “it is your bishop, who, from a sense of duty, and for your own justification, would learn from you, why you have not done that which, in the ordinary course of events, it was your strict duty to do?”

“My lord,” said Don Abbondio, “I do not mean to say,—but it appears to me, that as these things are now without remedy, it is useless to stir them up—However, however, I say, that I am sure your illustrious lordship would not betray a poor curate, because, you see, my lord, your illustrious lordship cannot be every where present, and I—I remain here, exposed—However, if you order me, I will tell all.”

“Speak; I ask for nothing but to find you free from blame.”

Don Abbondio then related his melancholy story, suppressing the name of the principal personage, and substituting in its place, “a great lord,”—thus giving to prudence the little that was left him in such an extremity.

“And you had no other motive?” asked the cardinal, after having heard him through.

“Perhaps I have not clearly explained myself. It was under pain of death that they ordered me not to perform the ceremony.”

“And this reason appeared sufficient to prevent the fulfilment of a rigorous duty?”

“I know my obligation is to do my duty, even to my greatest detriment; but when life is at stake——”

“And when you presented yourself to the church,” said Frederick, with increased severity of manner, “to be admitted to the holy ministry, were there any such reservations made? Were you told that the duties imposed by the ministry were free from every obstacle, exempt from every peril? Were you told that personal safety was to be the guide and limit of your duty? Were you not told expressly the reverse of all this? Were you not warned that you were sent as a lamb among wolves? Did you not even then know that there were violent men in the world, who would oppose you in the performance of your duty? He, whose example should be our guide, in imitation of whom we call ourselves shepherds, when he came on earth to accomplish the designs of his benevolence, did he pay regard to his own safety? And if your object be to preserve your miserable existence, at the expense of charity and duty, there was no necessity for your receiving holy unction, and entering into the priesthood. The world imparts this virtue, teaches this doctrine. What do I say? O shame! the world itself rejects it. It has likewise its laws, which prescribe good, and prohibit evil; it has also its gospel, a gospel of pride and hatred, which will not admit the love of life to be offered as a plea for the transgression of its laws. It commands, and is obeyed; but we, we children and messengers of the promise! what would become of the church, if your language was held by all your brethren? Where would she now be, if she had originally come forth with such doctrines?”

Don Abbondio hung down his head; he felt under the weight of these arguments as a chicken under the talons of a hawk, who holds him suspended in an unknown region, in an atmosphere he had never before breathed. Seeing that a reply was necessary, he said, more alarmed than convinced,—

“My lord, I have done wrong; since we should pay no regard to life, I have nothing more to say. But when one has to do with certain powerful people, who will not listen to reason, I do not see what is to be gained by carrying things with a high hand.”

“And know you not that our gain is to suffer for the sake of justice? If you are ignorant of this, what is it you preach? What do you teach? What is the good news which you proclaim to the poor? Who has required this at your hand, to overcome force by force? Certainly you will not be asked at the day of judgment, if you have vanquished the powerful, for you have neither had the commission nor the means to do so. But, you will be asked, if you have employed the means which have been placed in your power, to do that which was prescribed to you, even when man had the temerity to forbid it.”

“These saints are odd creatures,” thought Don Abbondio; “extract the essence of this discourse, and it will be found that he has more at heart the love of two young people, than the life of a priest.” He would have been delighted to have had the conversation terminate here, but he well perceived that such was not the intention of the cardinal, who appeared to be waiting a reply, or apology, or something of the kind.

“I say, my lord,” replied he, “that I have done wrong—We cannot give ourselves courage.”

“And why, then, I might say to you, have you undertaken a ministry which imposes on you the task of warring with the passions of the world? But, I will rather say, how is it that you have forgotten, that where courage is necessary to fulfil the obligations of this holy vocation, the Most High would assuredly impart it to you, were you earnestly to implore it? Do you think the millions of martyrs had courage naturally? that they had naturally a contempt for life, young Christians who had just begun to taste its charms, children, mothers! All had courage, simply because courage was necessary, and they trusted in God to impart it. Knowing your own weakness, have you ever thought of preparing yourself for the difficult situations in which you might be placed? Ah! if, during so many years of pastoral care, you had loved your flock, (and how could you refrain from loving them?) if you had reposed in them your affections, your dearest cares, your greatest delights, you would not have failed in courage: love is intrepid; if you had loved those who were committed to your spiritual guardianship, those whom you call children—if you had really loved them, when you beheld two of them threatened at the same time with yourself. Ah! certainly, charity would have made you tremble for them, as the weakness of the flesh made you tremble for yourself. You would have humbled yourself before God for the first risings of selfish terror; you would have considered it a temptation, and have implored strength to resist it. But, you would have eagerly listened to the holy and noble anxiety for the safety of others, for the safety of your children; you would have been unable to find a moment of repose; you would have been impelled, constrained to do all that you could to avert the evil that threatened them. With what then has this love, this anxiety, inspired you? What have you done for them? How have you been engaged in their service?”

And he paused for a reply.
CHAPTER XXVI.

Don Abbondio uttered not a word. It must be confessed that we ourselves, who have nothing to fear but the criticisms of our readers, feel a degree of repugnance in thus urging the unfashionable precepts of charity, courage, indefatigable solicitude for others, and unlimited sacrifice of self. But the reflection that these things were said by a man who practised what he preached, encourages us to proceed in our relation.

“You do not answer,” resumed the cardinal. “Ah! if you had followed the dictates of charity and duty, whatever had been the result, you would now have been at no loss for a reply. Behold, then, what you have done; you having obeyed iniquity, regardless of the requirements of duty; you have obeyed her promptly; she had only to show herself to you, and signify her desire, and she found you ready at her call. But she would have had recourse to artifice with one who was on his guard against her, she would have avoided exciting his suspicion, she would have employed concealment, that she might mature at leisure her projects of treachery and violence; she has, on the contrary, boldly ordered you to infringe your duty, and keep silence; you have obeyed, you have infringed it, and you have kept silence. I ask you now, if you have done nothing more. Tell me if it is true, that you have advanced false pretences for your refusal, so as not to reveal the true motive——”

“They have told this also, the tattlers!” thought Don Abbondio, but as he gave no indication of addressing himself to speech, the cardinal pursued,—“Is it true, that you told these young people falsehoods to keep them in ignorance and darkness?—I am compelled, then, to believe it; it only remains for me to blush for you, and to hope that you will weep with me. Behold where it has led you, (merciful God! and you advanced it as a justification!) behold to what it has conducted you, this solicitude for your life! It has led you——(repel freely the assertion if it appear to you unjust: take it as a salutary humiliation if it is not) it has led you to deceive the feeble and unfortunate, to lie to your children!”

“This is the way of the world!” thought Don Abbondio again; “to this devil incarnate,” (referring to the Unknown,) “his arms around his neck; and to me, for a half lie, reproaches without end! But you are our superiors; of course you are right. It is my star, that all the world is against me, not excepting the saints.” He continued aloud,—“I have done wrong! I see that I have done wrong. But what could I do in so embarrassing a situation?”

“Do you still ask? Have I not told you? And must I repeat it? You should have loved, my son, you should have loved and prayed; you would then have felt that iniquity might threaten, but not enforce obedience; you would have united, according to the laws of God, those whom man desired to separate; you would have exercised the ministry these children had a right to expect from you. God would have been answerable for the consequences, as you were obeying His orders; now, since you have obeyed man, the responsibility falls on yourself. And what consequences, just Heaven! And why did you not remember that you had a superior? How would he now dare to reprimand you for having failed in your duty, if he did not at all times feel himself obliged to aid you in its performance? Why did you not inform your bishop of the obstacles which infamous power exerted to prevent the exercise of your ministry?”

“Just the advice of Perpetua,” thought Don Abbondio vexed, to whose mind, even in the midst of these touching appeals, the images which most frequently presented themselves, were those of the bravoes and Don Roderick, alive and well, and returning at some future time, triumphant, and inflamed with rage. Although the presence, the aspect, and the language of the cardinal embarrassed him, and impressed him with a degree of apprehension, it was, however, an embarrassment and an apprehension which did not subjugate his thoughts, nor prevent him from reflecting that, after all, the cardinal employed neither arms nor bravoes.

“Why did you not think,” pursued Frederick, “that if no other asylum was open to these innocent victims, I could myself receive them, and place them in safety, if you had sent them to me; sent them afflicted and desolate to their bishop; as therefore belonging to him, as the most precious part, I say not of his charge, but of his wealth! And as for you, I should have been anxious for you; I would not have slept until certain that not a hair of your head would be touched; and do you not suppose that this man, however audacious he may be, would have lost something of his audacity, when convinced that his designs were known by me, that I watched over them, and that I was decided to employ for your defence all the means within my power! Know you not, that if man promises too often more than he performs, he threatens also more than he dare execute? Know you not that iniquity does not depend solely on its own strength, but on the credulity and cowardice of others?”

“Just the reasoning of Perpetua,” thought Don Abbondio, without considering that this singular coincidence in judgment of Frederick Borromeo and his servant, was an additional argument against him.

“But you,” pursued the cardinal, “you have only contemplated your own danger. How is it possible that your personal safety can have appeared of importance enough to sacrifice every thing to it?”

“Because I saw them, I saw those frightful faces,” escaped from Don Abbondio. “I heard those horrible words. Your illustrious worship talks well, but you should have been in the place of your poor priest, and have had the same thing happen to you.”

No sooner had he uttered these words than he bit his tongue, perceiving that he had suffered himself to be overcome by vexation; he muttered in a low voice, “Now for the storm!” and raising his eyes timidly, he was astonished to see the cardinal, whom he never could comprehend, pass from the severe air of authority and rebuke, to that of a soft and pensive gravity.

“It is but too true,” said Frederick. “Such is our terrible and miserable condition! We exact rigorously from others, that which it may be we would not be willing to render ourselves; we judge, correct, and reprimand, and God alone knows what we would do in the same situation, what we have done in similar situations. But, woe be to me, if I take my weakness for the measure of another's duty, for the rule of my instruction! Nevertheless it is certain, that while imparting precepts, I should also afford an example to my neighbour, and not resemble the pharisee, who imposes on others enormous burthens, which he himself would not so much as touch with his finger. Hear me then, my son, my brother; the errors of those in authority, are oftener better known to others than to themselves; if you know that I have, from cowardice, or respect to the opinions of men, neglected any part of my duty, tell me of it frankly, so that where I have failed in example, I may at least not be wanting in humble confession. Show me freely my weakness, and then words from my mouth will be more available, because you will be conscious that they do not proceed from me, but that they are the words of Him who can give to us both the necessary strength to do what He prescribes.”

“Oh! what a holy man, but what a troublesome one!” thought Don Abbondio. “He censures himself, and wishes that I should examine, criticise, and control even his actions!” He continued aloud,—“Oh! my lord jests, surely! Who does not know the courage and indefatigable zeal of your illustrious lordship?” “Yes,” added he to himself, “by far too indefatigable!”

“I do not desire praise that makes me tremble, because God knows my imperfections, and what I know of them myself is sufficient to humble me. But I would desire that we should humble ourselves together; I would desire that you should feel what your conduct has been, and that your language is opposed to the law you preach, and according to which you will be judged.”

“All turns against me. But these persons who have told your lordship these things, have they not also told you that they introduced themselves treacherously into my house, for the purpose of compelling me to perform the marriage ceremony, in a manner unauthorised by the church?”

“They have told me, my son; but what afflicts and depresses me, is to see you still seeking excuses; still excusing yourself by accusing others; still accusing others of that which should have formed a part of your own confession. Who placed these unfortunates, I do not say under the necessity, but under the temptation, to do what they have? Would they have sought this irregular method, if the legitimate way had not been closed to them? Would they have thought of laying snares for their pastor, if they had been received, aided, and advised by him? of surprising him, if he had not concealed himself? And you wish to make them bear the blame; and you are indignant that, after so many misfortunes, what do I say? in the very midst of misfortune, they have suffered a word of complaint to escape before their pastor and yours? that the complaints of the oppressed and the afflicted should be hateful to the world, is not astonishing; but to us! and what advantage would their silence have been to you? Would you have been the gainer from their cause having been committed entirely to the judgment of God? Is it not an additional reason to love them, that they have afforded you the occasion to hear the sincere voice of your pastor; that they have provided for you the means to understand more clearly, and quite as far as may be in your power, the great debt you have contracted to them? Ah! if they had even been the aggressors, I would tell you to love them for that very reason. Love them, because they have suffered, and do suffer; love them, because they are a part of your flock, because you yourself have need of pardon and of their prayers.”

Don Abbondio kept silence, but no longer from vexation, and an unwillingness to be persuaded; he kept silence from having more things to think of than to say. The words which he heard were unexpected conclusions, a new application of familiar doctrine. The evil done to his neighbour, which apprehension on his own account had hitherto prevented him from beholding in its true light, now made a novel and striking impression on his mind. If he did not feel all the remorse which the cardinal's remonstrances were calculated to produce, he experienced at least secret dissatisfaction with himself and pity for others; a blending of tenderness and shame; as, if we may be permitted to use the comparison, a humid and crushed taper at first hisses and smokes, but by degrees receives warmth, and imparts light, from the flame of a great torch to which it is presented. Don Abbondio would have loudly accused himself, and deplored his conduct, had not the idea of Don Roderick still obtruded itself into his thoughts; however, his feeling was sufficiently apparent to convince the cardinal that his words had at last produced some effect.

“Now,” pursued Frederick, “one of these unfortunate beings is a fugitive afar off, the other on the point of departure; both have but too much reason to keep asunder, without any present probability of being re-united. Now, alas! they have no need of you; now, alas! you have no longer the opportunity to do them good, and our short foresight can assure us of but little of the future. But who knows, if God in his compassion is not preparing the occasion for you? Ah! do not let it escape; seek it, watch for it, implore it as a blessing.”

“I shall not fail, my lord—I shall not fail to do so, I assure you,” replied Don Abbondio, in a tone that came from the heart.

“Ah! yes, my son, yes!” cried Frederick with affectionate dignity; “Heaven knows that I would have desired to hold other converse with you. We have both had a long pilgrimage through life. Heaven knows how painful it has been to me, to grieve your old age by reproaches; how much more I should have loved to occupy the time of this interview in mutual consolation, and mutual anticipation of the heavenly hope which is so near our grasp! God grant that the language I have been obliged to hold may be useful to both of us! Act in such a manner, that He will not call me to account on the great and terrible day, for having retained you in a ministry of which you were unworthy. Let us redeem the time; the night is far spent; the spouse will not linger; let us keep our lamps trimmed and burning. Let us offer to God our poor and miserable hearts, that he may fill them with his love!” So saying he arose to depart; Don Abbondio followed him.

We must now return to Donna Prassede, who came, according to agreement, on the following morning, for Lucy, and also to pay her duty to the cardinal. Frederick bestowed many praises on Lucy, and recommended her warmly to the kindness of Donna Prassede; Lucy separated herself from her mother with many tears, and again bade farewell to her cottage and her village. But she was cheered by the hope of seeing her mother once more before their final departure, as Donna Prassede informed them that it was her intention to remain for a few days at her villa, and Agnes promised to visit it again to take a last farewell.

The cardinal was on the point of setting out for another parish, when the curate of the village near which the castle of the Unknown was situated, demanded permission to see him. He presented a small packet, and a letter from that lord, in which Frederick was requested to present to Lucy's mother a hundred crowns of gold, to serve as a dowry for the maiden, or for any other purpose she might desire. The Unknown also requested him to tell them, that if ever they should be in need of his services, the poor girl knew but too well the place of his abode, and as for him, he should consider it a high privilege to afford her protection and assistance. The cardinal sent immediately for Agnes, and informed her of the commission he had received. She heard it with equal surprise and joy.

“God reward this signor!” said she; “your illustrious lordship will thank him in our name, but do not say a word of the matter to any one, because we live in a world—you will excuse me, I know a man like your lordship does not tattle about such things, but—you understand me.”

Returning to her house, she shut herself up in her chamber, and untied the packet; although she was prepared for the sight, she was filled with wonder at seeing in her own power and in one heap such a quantity of those coins which she had rarely ever seen before, and never more than one at a time. She counted them over and over again, and wrapping them carefully in a leather covering, concealed them under one corner of her bed. The rest of the day was employed in reverie and projects for the future, and desires for the arrival of the morrow; the night was passed in restless dreams, and vain imaginings of the blessings to be produced by this gold; at break of day, she arose, and departed for the villa of Donna Prassede.

The repugnance Lucy had felt to mention her vow, had not all diminished, but she resolved to overcome it, and to disclose the circumstance to her mother in this conversation, which would probably be the last they should have for a long time.

No sooner were they left alone, than Agnes, with an animated countenance, but in a low voice, said, “I have great news to tell you,” and she related her unexpected good fortune.

“God bless this signor,” said Lucy; “you have now enough to live comfortably yourself, and also to benefit others.”

“Oh! yes, we can do a great deal with this money! Listen, I have only you, that is, I have only you two in the world, for from the moment that Renzo first addressed you, I have considered him as my son. We will hope that no misfortune has befallen him, and that we shall soon hear from him. As for myself, I would have wished to lay my bones in my own country, but now that you cannot stay here on account of this villain, (oh! even to think that he was near me, would make me dislike any place!) I am quite willing to go away. I would have gone with you to the end of the earth before this good fortune, but how could we do it without money? The poor youth had indeed saved a few pence, of which the law deprived him, but in recompence God has sent us a fortune. So then, when he has informed us that he is living, and where he is, and what are his intentions, I will go to Milan for you—yes, I will go for you. Formerly I would not have dreamt of such a thing, but misfortune gives courage and experience. I have been to Monza, and I know what it is to travel. I will take with me a man of resolution; for instance, Alessio di Maggianico; I will pay the expense, and—do you understand?”

But perceiving that Lucy, instead of exhibiting sympathy with her plans, could with difficulty conceal her agitation and distress, she stopped in the midst of her harangue, exclaiming, “What is the matter? are you not of my opinion?”

“My poor mother!” cried Lucy, throwing her arms around her neck, and concealing on her bosom her face, bathed in tears.

“What is the matter?” said Agnes, in alarm.

“I ought to have told you sooner, but I had not the heart to do it. Have pity on me.”

“But speak, speak then.”

“I cannot be the wife of that unfortunate youth.”

“Why? how?”

Lucy, with downcast looks and flowing tears, confessed at last the vow which she had made. She clasped her hands, and asked pardon of her mother for having concealed it from her, conjuring her to speak of it to no one, and to lend her aid to enable her to fulfil it.

Agnes was overwhelmed with consternation; she would have been angry with her daughter for so long maintaining silence towards her, had not the grave thoughts that the circumstance itself excited, stifled all feeling of resentment. She would have blamed her for her vow, had it not appeared to her to be contending against Heaven; for Lucy described to her again, in more lively colours than before, that horrible night, her utter desolation, and unexpected preservation! Agnes listened attentively; and a hundred examples that she had often heard related, that she herself even had related to her daughter, of strange and horrible punishments for violated vows, came to her memory. “And what wilt thou do now?” said she.

“It is with the Lord that care rests; the Lord and the holy Virgin. I have placed myself in their hands; they have never yet abandoned me, they will not abandon me now that——The favour I ask of God, the only favour, after the safety of my soul, is to be restored to you, my beloved mother! He will grant it, yes, he will grant it. That fatal day——in the carriage——Oh! most holy Virgin! Those men——who would have thought I should be the next day with you?”

“But why not tell your mother at once?”

“Forgive me, I had not the heart——What use was there in afflicting you sooner?”

“And Renzo?” said Agnes, shaking her head.

“Ah!” cried Lucy, starting, “I must think no more of the poor youth. God has not intended——You see it appears to be his will that we should separate. And who knows?——But no, no; the Lord will preserve him from every danger, and render him, perhaps, happier without me.”

“But, nevertheless, if you had not bound yourself for ever, provided no misfortune has happened to Renzo, with this money, I would have found a remedy for all our other evils.”

“But, my mother, would this money have been ours if I had not passed that terrible night? It is God's will that all should be thus; his will be done!” And her voice became inarticulate through tears.

At this unexpected argument, Agnes maintained a mournful silence. After some moments, Lucy, suppressing her sobs, resumed,—“Now that the thing is done, we must submit cheerfully; and you, dear mother, you can aid me, first in praying to the Lord for your poor daughter, and then it is necessary that Renzo should know it. When you ascertain where he is, have him written to, find a man,—your cousin Alessio, for instance, who is prudent and kind, who has always wished us well, and who will not tattle. Make Alessio write to him, and inform him of the circumstance as it occurred, where I was, and how I suffered; tell him that God has ordered it thus, and that he must set his heart at rest; that, as for me, I can never be united to any one. Make him understand the matter clearly; when he knows that I have promised the Virgin——he always has been pious——And you, as soon as you hear from him, get some one to write to me, let me know that he is safe and well——and, nothing more.”

Agnes, with much emotion, assured her daughter that all should be done as she desired.

“I would say something more; that which has befallen the poor youth, would never have occurred to him, if he had never thought of me. He is a wanderer, a fugitive; he has lost all his little savings; he has been deprived of every thing he possessed, poor fellow! and you know why—and we, we have so much money! Oh! mother, since the Lord has sent us wealth, and since the unfortunate——you regard him as your son, do you not? Ah! divide it, share it with him! Endeavour to find a safe man, and send him the half of it. God knows how much he may need it!”

“That is just what I was thinking of,” replied Agnes. “Yes, I will do it certainly. Poor youth! And why did you think I was so pleased with the money, if it were not——but—I came here well pleased,'tis true; but, since matters are so, I will send it to him. Poor youth! he also——I know what I mean. Certainly money gives pleasure to those who have need of it; but this money—Ah! it is not this that will make him prosper.”

Lucy returned thanks to her mother for her prompt and liberal accordance with her request, so fervently, that an observer would have imagined her heart to be still devoted to Renzo, more than she herself was aware of.

“And without thee, what shall I do—I, thy poor mother?” said Agnes, weeping in her turn.

“And I, without you, my dear mother? and in a house of strangers, at Milan? But the Lord will be with us both, and will re-unite us. In eight or nine months we shall see each other again; let us leave it to him. I will incessantly implore this favour from the Virgin; if I had any thing more to offer her, I would not hesitate; but she is so compassionate, she will surely grant my prayer.”

The mother and daughter parted with many tears, promising to see each other again, the coming autumn, at the latest, as if it depended on themselves!

A long time elapsed before Agnes heard any thing of Renzo; neither message nor letter was received from him; the people of the village were as ignorant concerning him as herself.

She was not the only one whose enquiries had been fruitless; it was not a mere ceremony in the cardinal Frederick, when he promised Lucy and Agnes, to inform himself of the history and fate of Renzo; he fulfilled that promise, by writing immediately to Bergamo for the purpose. While at Milan, on his return from visiting his diocese, he received a reply, in which he was informed that little was known of the young man; that he had made, it was true, a short sojourn in such a place, but that one morning he had suddenly disappeared; that a relation of his, with whom he had lived while there, knew not what had become of him; he thought that he had probably enlisted for the Levant, or had passed into Germany, or, which was most likely, that he had perished in crossing the river. It was added, however, that should any more definite intelligence be received concerning him, his illustrious lordship should immediately be informed of it.

These reports eventually travelled to Lecco, and reached the ears of Agnes. The poor woman did her best to ascertain the truth of them; but she was kept in a state of suspense and anxiety by the contradictory accounts which were given, and which were, in fact, all without foundation.

The governor of Milan, lieutenant-general under Don Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, had complained bitterly to the lord resident of Venice at Milan, that a robber, a villain, an instigator of pillage and massacre, the famous Lorenzo Tramaglino, had been received in the Bergamascan territory. The resident replied, that he knew nothing of the matter, but that he would write to Venice for information concerning it, in order to give some explanation to his Excellency.

It was a maxim at Venice to encourage the tendency of the Milanese workmen in silk, to establish themselves in the Bergamascan territory, by making them find it to their advantage to do so. For this reason, Bortolo was warned confidentially, that Renzo was not safe in his present residence, and that he would do wisely to place him in some other manufactory, and even cause him to change his name for a while. Bortolo, who was quick of apprehension, made no objections, related the matter to his cousin, and taking him to another place fifteen miles off, he presented him, under the name of Antonio Rivolta, to the master of the manufactory, who was a native of Milan, and moreover his old acquaintance. He, although the times were hard, did not require much entreaty to induce him to receive a workman so warmly recommended by an old friend. He saw reason afterwards to congratulate himself on the acquisition, although, at first, the young man appeared rather heedless, because, when they called Antonio, he scarcely ever answered.

A short time after, an order arrived from Venice to the captain of Bergamo, to inform himself, and send word to government, whether there was not within his jurisdiction, and particularly in such a village, such an individual. The captain having obeyed in the best manner he could, transmitted a reply in the negative, which was transmitted to the resident at Milan, in order that he should transmit it to Don Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova.

There were not wanting inquisitive people, who enquired of Bortolo why the young man had left him. The first time the question was put to him, he simply replied, “He has disappeared.” To relieve himself, however, from the most persevering, he framed the stories we have already related, at the same time offering them as mere reports that he had heard; without, however, placing much reliance on them.

But when enquiry came to be made by order of the cardinal, or rather, by order of some great person, as his name was not mentioned, Bortolo became more uneasy, and judged it prudent to maintain his ordinary method of reply, with this addition, that he gave to the stories he had fabricated an air of greater verity and plausibility.

We must not conclude, however, that Don Gonzalo had any personal dislike to our poor mountaineer; we must not conclude that, informed perhaps of his disrespect and ill-timed jests upon his Moorish king enchained by the throat, he wished to wreak his vengeance on him, nor that he considered him a person dangerous enough to be pursued even in his flight, as was Hannibal by the Roman senate. Don Gonzalo had too many things to think of, to trouble himself with the actions of Renzo, and if he appeared to do so, it was the result of a singular concurrence of circumstances; by which the poor fellow, without wishing it, or even knowing why, found himself attached, as by an invisible thread, to numerous and important affairs.
CHAPTER XXVII.

We have had occasion to mention more than once a war which was then fermenting, for the succession to the states of the Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, the second of the name; we have said that, at the death of this duke, his nearest heir, Carlos Gonzaga, chief of a younger branch transplanted to France, where he possessed the duchies of Nevers and Rhetel, had entered into possession of Mantua and Montferrat; the Spanish minister, who wished, at any price, to exclude from these two fiefs the new prince, and wanted some pretence to advance for his exclusion, had declared his intention to support the claims upon Mantua of another Gonzaga, Ferrante, Prince of Guastalla; and those upon Montferrat of Carlos Emanuel the First, Duke of Savoy, and Margherita Gonzaga, Duchess dowager of Lorraine. Don Gonzalo, who was descended from the great captain whose name he bore, had already made war in Flanders; and as he was desirous beyond measure to direct one in Italy, he made the greatest efforts to promote it. By interpreting the intentions, and by going beyond the orders of the minister, he had, in the mean time, concluded with the Duke of Savoy a treaty for the invasion and division of Montferrat; and easily obtained the ratification of it, by the count duke, by persuading him that the acquisition of Casale, which was the point the best defended, of the portion granted to the King of Spain, was extremely easy. However, he still continued to protest, in the name of his sovereign, that he desired to occupy the country only as a trust, until the decision of the emperor should be declared. But in the meantime the emperor, influenced by others as well as by motives of his own, had refused the investiture to the new duke, and ordered him to leave in sequestration, the states which had been the subject of contention; promising, after he should have heard both parties, to give it to the one whom he should deem justly entitled to it. The Duke of Nevers would not submit to these conditions.

The duke had high and powerful friends, being supported by the Cardinal Richelieu, the senate of Venice, and the pope. But the first of these, absorbed at the time by the siege of Rochelle, embarrassed in a war with England, thwarted by the party of the queen mother, Mary de' Medici, who, for particular reasons, was hostile to the house of Nevers, could only hold out hopes and promises. The Venetians would not stir in the contest, until a French army arrived in Italy; and while secretly aiding the duke, they confined themselves, in their negotiations with the court of Madrid, and the government of Milan, to protests, offers, or even threats, according to circumstances. Urban VIII. recommended the Duke of Nevers to his friends, interceded for him with his adversaries, and made propositions of peace; but he never afforded him any military aid.

The two powers, allied for offensive operations, could then securely begin their enterprise; Carlos Emanuel entered Montferrat, and Don Gonzalo gladly undertook the siege of Casale; but he did not meet with the success he had anticipated. The court did not afford him all the supplies he demanded; his ally, on the contrary, was too liberal in his aid to the cause; for, after having taken his own portion, he also took that which had been assigned to the King of Spain. Don Gonzalo, inexpressibly enraged, but fearing, if he made the least complaint, that Carlos, as active in intrigue, and as brave in arms, as he was fickle in disposition, and false to his promises, would throw himself on the side of France; was constrained to shut his eyes, to champ the bit, and to maintain a satisfied appearance. Whether from the firm resistance of the besieged, or from the small number of troops employed against them, or, according to some statements, from the numerous mistakes of Don Gonzalo, the siege, although protracted, was finally unsuccessful. It was at this very period that the sedition of Milan obliged Don Gonzalo to go thither in person.

In the relation that was there made to him, the flight of Renzo was mentioned, and the facts, real or supposed, which had caused his arrest; he was also informed that this man had taken refuge in the territory of Bergamo. This latter circumstance attracted the attention of Don Gonzalo; he knew that the Venetians had taken an interest in the insurrection of Milan, and that, in the beginning of it, they had imagined that, on that account alone, he would be obliged to raise the siege of Casale, and thus incur a heavy disappointment to his hopes. In addition to this, immediately after this event, the news was received, so much desired by the senate, and so much dreaded by Gonzalo, of the surrender of Rochelle. Stung to the quick, as a man and a politician, and vexed at his loss of reputation, he sought out every occasion to convince the Venetians, that he had lost none of his former boldness and determination; he therefore ventured to make loud complaints of the conduct of the senate. The resident of Venice, having come to pay his respects to him, and endeavouring to read in his features and deportment what was passing in his mind, Don Gonzalo spoke lightly of the tumult, as a thing already quieted, making use, however, of the reception of Renzo, in the Bergamascan territory, as a pretext for complaint against the Venetians. The result is known to our readers. When he had answered his own purposes, with the affair, it was entirely forgotten by him.

But Renzo, who was far from suspecting the little importance that was in reality attached to him, had, for a long time, no other thought but to keep himself concealed. It may well be supposed that he desired ardently to send intelligence to Lucy and her mother, and to hear from them in return. But to this, there were two very great obstacles. It was necessary to confide in an amanuensis, as he himself was unable to write,—an accomplishment in those days not very usual in his class; and how could he venture to do this where all were strangers to him? The other difficulty was to find a trusty messenger, to take charge of the letter. He finally succeeded in overcoming these difficulties, and found one of his companions who could write for him. But not knowing whether Lucy and Agnes were still at Monza, he thought it best to enclose the letter under cover to Father Christopher, with a few lines in addition to him. The writer engaged to send it, and gave it to a man who was to pass near Pescarenico, and who left it in an inn on the route, in a neighbouring place to the convent, and with many injunctions for its safe delivery. As the cover was directed to a capuchin, it was carried to Pescarenico, but it was never known what farther became of it. Renzo, not receiving an answer, caused another letter to be written, and enclosed it to one of his relations at Lecco. This time the letter reached its destination. Agnes requested her cousin Alessio to read it for her; and to write an answer, which was sent to Antonio Rivolta, at the place of his abode; all this, however, was not done so quickly as we tell it. Renzo received the answer, and wrote a reply; in short, there was a correspondence, however irregular, established between them. But the manner of carrying on such a correspondence, which is the same, perhaps, at this day, we will explain. The absent party who can't write, selects one who possesses the art, from amongst his own class, in which he can more securely trust. To him he explains with more or less clearness his subject and his thoughts. The man of letters comprehends part, guesses the rest, gives an opinion, proposes an alteration, and finishes with “leave it to me.” Then begins the translation of the spoken into the written thoughts.—The writer corrects, improves, overcharges, diminishes, or even omits, according to his opinion of the graces of style. The finished letter is, accordingly, often wide of the mark aimed at. But when, at length, it reaches the hands of a correspondent, equally deficient in the art of reading running hand, he is under the like necessity of finding a learned clerk of the same calibre to interpret the hieroglyphics. Hereupon arise questions upon the various meanings. Towards their elucidation, the one supplies philological notices upon the text; the other, commentaries upon the hidden matter; so that, after mature discussion, they may come to the same understanding between themselves, however remote that may be from the intention of the originator of the perplexity.

This was precisely the condition of our two correspondents.

The first letter from Renzo contained many details; he informed Agnes of the circumstance of his flight, his subsequent adventures, and his actual situation. These events, however, were rather hinted at, than clearly explained, so that Agnes and her interpreter were far from drawing any definite conclusions from the relation of them. He spoke of secret information, of a change of name; that he was in safety, but that he was obliged to keep himself concealed; further, the letter contained pressing and passionate enquiries with regard to Lucy, with some obscure references to the reports which had reached him, mingled with vague expressions of hope, and plans for the future, and affectionate exhortations to constancy and patience.

Some time after the receipt of this letter, Agnes sent Renzo an answer, with the fifty crowns that had been assigned him by Lucy. At the sight of so much gold, he did not know what to think; and, with his mind agitated by reflections by no means agreeable, he went in search of his amanuensis, requesting him to interpret the letter, and afford him a clue to the developement of the mystery.

The amanuensis of Agnes, after some complaints on the want of clearness in Renzo's epistle, described the wonderful history of this person (so he called the Unknown), and thus accounted for the fifty crowns; then he mentioned the vow, but only periphrastically; adding more explicitly the advice, to set his heart at rest, and not to think of Lucy any more.

Renzo was very near quarrelling with his interpreter; he trembled; he was enraged with what he had understood, and with what he had not understood. He made him read three or four times this melancholy epistle, sometimes understanding it better, sometimes finding obscure and inexplicable that which at first had appeared clear. In the delirium of his passion, he desired his amanuensis to write an answer immediately. After the strongest expressions of pity and horror at the misfortunes of Lucy; “Write,” pursued he, “that I do not wish to set my heart at rest, and that I never will; that this is not advice to give me; and that, moreover, I will never touch the money, but will keep it in trust, as the dowry of the young girl; that Lucy belongs to me, and that I will not abide by her vow; that I have always heard that the Virgin interests herself in our affairs, for the purpose of aiding the afflicted, and obtaining favour for them; but that I have never heard that she will protect those who do evil, and fail to perform their promises; say that, as such cannot be the case, her vow is good for nothing; that with this money we can establish ourselves here, and that, if our affairs are now a little perplexed, it is a storm which will soon pass away.”

Agnes received this letter, sent an answer, and the correspondence continued for some time, as we have related. When her mother informed Lucy that Renzo was well and in safety, she derived great relief from the intelligence, desiring but one thing more, which was, that he should forget, or rather, that he should endeavour to forget her. On her part she made a similar resolution, with respect to him, a hundred times a day; and employing every means of which she was mistress to accomplish so desirable an end, she applied herself incessantly to labour, endeavouring to give to it all the powers of her soul. When the image of Renzo occurred to her mind, she tried to banish it by prayer; but, while thinking of her mother, (and how could she avoid thinking of her mother?) the image of Renzo intruded himself as a third into the place so often occupied by the real Renzo. However, if she did not succeed in forgetting, she contrived at least to think less frequently of him; and in this she would have been more successful, had she been left to prosecute the work alone; but, alas! Donna Prassede, who, on her part, was determined to drive the poor youth from her mind, thought there was no better expedient for the purpose than to talk of him incessantly; “Well,” said she, “do you still think of him?”

“I think of no one,” said Lucy.

Donna Prassede, who was not a woman to be satisfied with such an answer, replied, “that she wanted actions, not words.” Discussing at length, the tendencies of young girls, she said, “When they have once given their heart to a libertine, it is impossible to withdraw their affections. If their love for an honest man is, by whatever means, unfortunate, they are soon comforted, but love for a libertine is an incurable wound.” And then beginning the panegyric of poor Renzo, of this rascal, who wished to deluge Milan in blood, and reduce it to ashes, she concluded, by insisting that Lucy should confess the crimes of which he had been guilty in his own country.

Lucy, with a voice trembling from shame, grief, and from as much indignation as her gentle disposition and humble station permitted her, declared and protested, that in her village this poor youth had always acted peaceably and honourably, and had obtained a good reputation. “She wished,” she said, “that one of his countrymen were present to bear testimony to the truth.” Even respecting the events at Milan, of which, 'twas true, she knew not the details, she defended him, and solely on account of the acquaintance she had had with his habits from infancy. She defended him (or rather, she meant to defend him) from the pure duty of charity, from love of truth, and as being her neighbour. But Donna Prassede deduced, from this defence, new arguments to convince Lucy, that this man still held a place in her heart, of which he was not worthy. At the degrading portrait which the old lady drew of him, the habitual feelings of her heart, with regard to him, and her knowledge and estimate of his character, revived with double force and distinctness. Her recollections, which she had had so much difficulty in subduing, returned vividly to her imagination; in proportion to the aversion and contempt manifested by Donna Prassede towards the unfortunate youth, just in such proportion did she recall her former motives for esteem and sympathy; this blind and violent hatred excited in her heart stronger pity and tenderness. Such conversations could not be much prolonged without resolving Lucy's words into tears.

If Donna Prassede had been led to this course of conduct by hatred towards Lucy, the tears of the latter, which flowed freely during these examinations, might have subdued her to silence, but as she was moved to speak by the desire of doing good, she never suffered herself to be softened by them; for groans and supplications may arrest the arm of an enemy, but not the friendly lance of the surgeon. After having reproached her for her wickedness, she passed to exhortations and advice, mingling also a few praises, to temper the bitter with the sweet, and obtain more certainly the effect she desired. These disputes, which had nearly the same beginning, middle, and end, did not, however, leave any trace of resentment against her severe lecturer in the gentle bosom of Lucy; she was, in other respects, treated with much kindness by the lady, and she believed her, even in this matter, to be guided by good, though mistaken intentions. There did follow them, however, such agitation, such uneasy awakening of slumbering thoughts, that much time and effort were requisite to restore her to any degree of tranquillity.

It was a happiness for Lucy that Donna Prassede's sphere of usefulness was somewhat extensive; consequently these tiresome conversations could not be so frequently repeated. Besides her immediate household, composed, according to her opinion, of persons that had more or less need of correction and regulation; and besides all the other occasions which presented themselves for her rendering the same office from pure benevolence to persons who required not the duty at her hands; she had five daughters, neither of whom lived at home, but they gave her the more trouble from that very cause. Three were nuns; and two were married. Donna Prassede consequently had three monasteries and two families to govern; a vast and complicated machinery, and the more troublesome, as two husbands, supported by a numerous kindred, three abbesses, defended by other dignitaries, and a great number of nuns, would not accept her superintendence. There was a continual warfare, polite indeed, but active and vigilant; a perpetual attention to avoid her solicitude, to close up the avenues to her advice, to elude her enquiries, and to keep her in as much ignorance as possible of their affairs. In her own family, however, her zeal could display itself freely; all were governed by her authority, and submissive to her, in every respect, with the exception of Don Ferrante; with him things were conducted in a peculiar manner.

A man of study, he neither loved to obey nor command; he was perfectly willing that his wife should be mistress in all things pertaining to household affairs, but not that he should be her slave; and if, at her request, he lent upon occasion the services of his pen, it was because he had a particular taste for such employments. And, moreover, he could refuse to do it, when not convinced of the propriety of her demand. “Well,” he would say, “do it yourself, since the matter appears so plain to you.” Donna Prassede, after vainly trying to induce him to submission, took refuge in grumbling against him as an original, a man who would have his own way, a mere scholar; which latter title, however, she never gave him without a degree of complacency, mingling itself with her displeasure.

Don Ferrante passed much time in his study, where he had a considerable collection of choice books; he had selected the most famous works on many different subjects, in each of which he was more or less versed. In astrology he was justly considered more than an amateur, because he not only possessed the general notions, and the common vocabulary of influences, aspects, and conjunctions, but he could speak to the point, and, like a professor, of the twelve houses of heaven, of the great and lesser circles, of degrees, lucid and obscure, of exaltations, passages, and revolutions; in short, of the principles the most certain and most recondite of the science. For more than twenty years, in long and frequent disputes, he had sustained the pre-eminence of Cardan against another learned man attached to the system of Alcabizio, “from pure obstinacy,” said Don Ferrante, who, in acknowledging voluntarily the superiority of the ancients, could not, however, endure the prejudice which would never accord to the moderns, even that which they evidently deserved. He had also a more than ordinary acquaintance with the history of the science; he could cite the most celebrated predictions which had been verified, and reason very skilfully and learnedly on other celebrated predictions which had not been verified, demonstrating that the failure was not owing to any deficiency in the science, but to the ignorance which could not apply its principles.

He had acquired as much ancient philosophy as would have contented a man of ordinary ambition, but he was continually adding to his stock from the study of Diogenes Laertius; however, as we cannot adhere to every system, and as, from among them all, a choice is necessary to him who desires the reputation of a philosopher, Don Ferrante made choice of Aristotle, who, as he was accustomed to say, was neither ancient nor modern. He possessed many works of the wisest and most subtle disciples of the school of Aristotle among the moderns; as to those of his opponents, he would not read them, “because it would be a waste of time,” he said, “nor buy them, because it would be a waste of money.” In the judgment of the learned, therefore, Don Ferrante passed for an accomplished peripatetic, although this was not the judgment he passed on himself, for, more than once, he was heard to declare, with singular modesty, that the essence, the universals, the soul of the world, and the nature of things, were not matters so clear as people thought.

As to natural philosophy, he had made it more a pastime than a study: he had rather read than digested the works of Aristotle himself on the subject. Nevertheless, with a slight acquaintance with that author, and the knowledge he had incidentally gathered from other treatises of general philosophy, he could, when necessary, entertain an assembly of learned persons in reasoning most acutely on the wonderful virtues and singular characteristics of many plants. He could describe exactly the forms and habits of the syrens, and the phœnix, the only one of its kind; he could explain how it was that the salamander lived in fire, how drops of dew became pearls in the shell, how the chameleon lived on air, and a thousand other secrets of the same nature.

He was, however, much more addicted to the study of magic and sorcery, as this was a science more in vogue, and withal more serviceable, and the facts of which were of pre-eminent importance. It is not necessary to add that, in devotion to such a science, he had no other purpose than to obtain an accurate knowledge of the worst artifices of the sorcerers, in order to guard himself against them. Guided by the great Martino Delrio, he was able to discourse, ex professo, on the enchantment of love, the enchantment of sleep, the enchantment of hatred, and on the innumerable species of these three chief enchantments, which, alas! are witnessed every day in their destructive and baneful effects.

His knowledge of history, especially universal history, was not less vast and solid. “But,” said he often, “what is history without politics? a guide who conducts without teaching any one the way; as politics without history, is a man without a guide to conduct him.” Here was then a small place on his shelf assigned to statistics; there, among others of the second rank, were seen Bodin, Cavalcanti, Sansovino, Paruta, and Boccalini. There were, however, two books that Don Ferrante preferred to all others on the subject; two, which he called, for a long time, the first of the kind, without deciding to which of the two this rank exclusively belonged. One was Il Principe and the Discorsi of the celebrated secretary of Florence. “A rascal, 'tis true,” said he, “but profound;” the other, La Ragion di Stato, of the not less celebrated Giovanni Botero. “An honest man, 'tis true,” said he, “but cunning.” But, a short time before the period to which our history belongs, a work appeared which had terminated the question of pre-eminence; a work in which was comprised and condensed a relation of every vice, in order to enable men to avoid it, and every virtue, in order to enable men to practise it,—a book of few leaves, indeed, but all of gold; in a word, the Statista Regnante of Don Valeriano Castiglione; of the celebrated man upon whom the most learned men emulated each other in bestowing praises, and for whose notice the greatest personages contended; whom Pope Urban VIII. honoured with a magnificent eulogium; whom Cardinal Borghese and the Viceroy of Naples, Don Pietro de Toledo, solicited to write, the first, the life of Pope Paul V., the second, the wars of the Catholic king in Italy, and both in vain; whom Louis XIII., King of France, with the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, named his historiographer; upon whom the Duke Carlos Emanuel, of Savoy, conferred the same office; and in praise of whom the Duchess Christina, daughter to his most Christian majesty, Henry IV., added in a diploma, after many other titles, “the renown he had obtained in Italy as the first writer of the age.”

But if Don Ferrante might be said to be well versed in all the above sciences, there was one in which he deserved, and really obtained, the title of professor, the science of chivalry. He not only spoke of it as a master, but was often requested to interfere in nice points of honour, and give his decision. He had in his library, and, we may add, in his head also, the works of the most esteemed writers on this subject, particularly Torquato Tasso, whom he had always ready; and he could, if required, cite from memory all the passages of the Jerusalem Delivered, which might be brought forward as authority in these matters. We might speak more at large of this learned man, but we feel it to be time to resume the thread of our history.

Nothing of importance occurred to any of the personages of our story before the following autumn, when Agnes and Lucy expected to meet again; but a great public event disappointed this hope. Other events followed, which produced no material change in their destiny. Then occurred new misfortunes, powerful and overwhelming, coming upon them like a hurricane, which impetuously tears up and scatters every object in its way, sweeping the land, and bearing off, with its irresistible and mighty power, every vestige of peace and prosperity. That the particular facts which remain to be related may not appear obscure, we must recur for awhile to the farther recital of general facts.
CHAPTER XXVIII.

After the famous sedition on St. Martin's day, it may be said that abundance flowed into Milan, as if by enchantment. The shops were well stored with bread, the price of which was no higher than in the most fruitful years; those who, on that terrible day, had howled through the streets, and committed every excess in their power, had now reason to congratulate themselves. But, with the cessation of their alarm, they had not resumed their accustomed quiet; on the squares, and in the inns, there were congratulations and boastings (although in an under tone) at having hit on a mode of reducing the price of bread. However, in the midst of these popular rejoicings, there reigned a vague apprehension and presentiment that this happiness would be of short duration. They besieged the bakers and vendors of flour with the same pertinacity as during the period of the former factitious and transient abundance, produced by the first tariff of Antony Ferrer. He who had some pence by him converted them immediately into bread and flour, which was piled in chests, in small casks, and even in vessels of earthen ware. In thus attempting to extend the advantages of the moment, their long duration was rendered, I do not say impossible, for it was so already; but even their momentary continuance thus became still more difficult.

On the fifteenth of November, Antony Ferrer, “by the order of his excellency,” published a decree in which it was forbidden to any one, having any quantity of grain or flour in his house, to purchase more; and to the rest of the people to buy bread beyond that which was necessary for two days, “under pecuniary and corporal penalties at the discretion of his excellency.” The decree ordered the anziani (officers of justice), and invited every body, as a duty, to denounce the offenders; it commanded the judges to cause search to be made in every house which might be mentioned to them, issuing at the same time a new command to the bakers to keep their shops well furnished with bread, “under penalty of five years in the galleys, and still greater punishment at the discretion of his excellency.” A great effort of imagination would be required to believe that such orders were easy of execution.

In commanding the bakers to make such a quantity of bread, means ought to have been afforded for the supply of the material of which it was to be made. In seasons of scarcity, there is always an endeavour to make into bread various kinds of aliment, which, under ordinary circumstances, are consumed under other forms. In this way rice was introduced into the composition of a bread which was called mistura.[33] On the 23d of November, there was a decree issued, which placed at the order of the vicar and twelve members of provision the half of the rice that each possessed; under penalty for selling it without the permission of those lords of the loss of the entire commodity, and a fine of three crowns the bushel.

But this rice had to be paid for at a price very disproportioned to that of bread. The burden of supplying this enormous difference was imposed on the city: but the council of ten resolved to send a remonstrance to the governor, on the impossibility of sustaining such a tax; and the governor fixed, by a decree of the 13th of December, the price of rice at twelve livres the bushel. It is also probable, though nowhere expressly stated, that the maximum price for other sorts of grain was fixed by other proclamations. Whilst, by these various measures, bread and flour were kept at a low price in Milan, it consequently happened that crowds of people rushed into the city to supply their wants. Don Gonzalo, to remedy this inconvenience, forbade, by another decree of the 15th of December, the carrying out of the city bread to the value of more than twenty pence; the penalty was a fine of “twenty-five crowns, and in case of inability, a public flogging, and greater punishments still, at the discretion of his excellency.”

The populace wished to procure abundance by pillage and conflagration, the legal power wished to maintain it by the galleys and the rope. Every method was resorted to to accomplish their purpose, but the reader will soon learn the total failure of them all. It is, besides, easy to see, and not useless to observe, that these strange means had an intimate and necessary connection with each other; each was the inevitable consequence of the preceding, and all, in fact, flowed from the first error, that of fixing upon bread a price so disproportioned to that which ought to have resulted from the real state of things. Such an expedient, however, has always appeared to the populace not only conformable to equity, but very simple and easy of execution; it is then very natural that in the agonies and misery which are the necessary effects of scarcity, they should, if it be in their power, adopt it. But as the consequences begin to be felt, the government is obliged to repair the evil by new laws, forbidding men to do that which previous laws had recently prescribed to them.

The principal fruits of the insurrection were these; the destruction or loss of much provision in the insurrection itself, and the rapid consumption of the small quantity of grain then on hand, which should otherwise have lasted until the next harvest. To these general effects may be added, the punishment of four of the populace, who were hung as leaders of the sedition, two before the baker's shop of the crutches, and two at the corner of the street in which was situated the house of the superintendent of provision.

The historical relations of this epoch are handed down to us with so little clearness, that it is difficult to ascertain when this arbitrary tariff ceased. But we have numerous accounts of the situation of the country, and especially the city, in the winter of that year and the following spring. In every quarter shops were closed; and the manufactories were, for the most part, deserted; the streets afforded a terrible spectacle of sorrow and desolation; mendicants by profession, now the smallest number, were confounded with the new multitude, disputing for alms with those from whom they had formerly been accustomed to receive them; clerks and servants, dismissed by the merchants and shopkeepers, hardly existing upon some scanty savings; merchants and shopkeepers themselves failing and ruined by the stoppage of trade; artificers wandering from door to door, lying along the pavement, by the houses and churches, soliciting charity, and hesitating between want and shame, emaciated and feeble, reduced by long fasting, and the rigours of the cold which penetrated their tattered clothing; servants, dismissed by their masters, who were incapable of maintaining their accustomed numerous and sumptuous establishments; and the numerous dependents upon the labour of these various classes, old men, women, and children, grouped around their former supporters, or wandered in search of support elsewhere.

Among the wretched crowds also might be distinguished, by their long lock, by the remnants of their magnificent apparel, by their carriage and gestures, and by the traces which habit impresses on the countenance, many bravoes, who, having lost in the common misery their criminal means of support, were reduced to an equality of suffering, and with difficulty dragged themselves along the city that they had so often traversed with a proud and ferocious bearing, magnificently armed and attired; they now extended with humility the hand which they had so frequently raised to menace with insolence, or to strike with treachery.

But the most dense, livid, and hideous swarm was that of the villagers. These were seen in entire families; husbands with their wives, dragging along their little ones, and supporting in their arms their wretched babies, whilst their own aged and helpless parents followed behind,—all flocked into the city in hopes of obtaining bread. Some, whose houses had been invaded and despoiled by the soldiery, had fled in despair; some, to excite compassion, and render their misery more striking, showed the wounds and bruises they had received in defending their homes; and others, whom this scourge had not reached, had been driven, by the two scourges from which no corner of the country was exempt, sterility and the consequent increase on the price of provisions, to the city, as to the abode of abundance and pious munificence. The new comers might be recognised by their air of angry astonishment and disappointment at finding such an excess of misery where they had hoped to be themselves the peculiar objects of compassion and benevolence. Here, too, might be recognised, in all their varieties of ragged habiliments, in the midst of the general wretchedness, the pale dweller of the marsh, the bronzed countenance of the plain or hill countryman, and the sanguine complexion of the mountaineer, all, however, alike in the hollow eye, ferocious or insane countenance, knotted hair, long and matted beard, attenuated body, shrivelled skin and bony breast,—all alike reduced to the lowest condition of languor, of infantine debility.

Heaps of straw and stubble were seen along the walls, and by the gutters, which appeared to be a particular provision of charity for these unfortunate creatures; there their limbs reposed during the night; and in the day they were occupied by those who, exhausted by fatigue and suffering, could no longer bear the weight of their emaciated bodies; sometimes, upon the damp straw a dead body lay extended; sometimes, the miserable spark of life was rekindled in its feeble tenement by timely succour from a hand rich in the means and in the disposition to do good, the hand of the pious Frederick.

He had made choice of six priests of ardent charity and robust constitution; and, dividing them into three companies, assigned to each the third of the city as their charge; they were accompanied by porters, laden with food, cordials, and clothing. Each morning these worthy messengers of benevolence passed through the streets, approached those whom they beheld stretched on the pavement, and gave to each their kindly assistance. Those who were too ill to be benefited by temporal succour received from them the last offices of religion.

Their assistance was not limited to present relief: the good bishop requested them, wherever it was possible, to furnish more efficacious and permanent comfort, by giving to those who should be in some measure restored to strength money for their future necessities, lest returning want should again plunge them into wretchedness and misery; and to obtain shelter for others who lay exposed in the street in the neighbouring houses, by requesting their inhabitants to receive the poor afflicted ones as boarders, whose expenses would be paid by the cardinal himself.

Frederick had not waited for the evil to attain its height, in order to exercise his benevolence, and to devote all the powers of his mind towards its amelioration. By uniting all his means, by practising strict economy, by drawing upon the sums destined to other liberalities, and which had now become of secondary importance, he endeavoured to amass money, in order to employ it entirely for those who were suffering from hunger and its consequences. He bought a quantity of grain, and sent it to the most destitute parts of his diocese; but as the succour was far from adequate to the necessity, he sent with it a great quantity of salt, “with which,” says Ripamonti[34], relating the fact, “the herbs of the field and the leaves of trees were made food for men.” He distributed grain and money to the curates of the city; and he himself travelled over it, administering alms, and secretly aiding many indigent families. In the episcopal palace, rice was boiled every day, and dealt out to the necessities of the people, to the extent of 2000 measures. Besides these splendid efforts of a single individual, many other excellent persons, though with less powerful means, strove to mitigate the horrible sufferings of the people: of these sufferers, thousands struggled to grasp the broth or other food provided at different quarters, and thus prolong for a day, at least, their miserable lives; but thousands were still left behind in the struggle, and these generally the weakest,—the aged women and children; and these might be seen, dead and dying from inanition, in every part. But in the midst of these calamities not the least disposition to insurrection appeared.

The void that mortality created each day in the miserable multitude was each day more than replenished; there was a perpetual concourse, at first from the neighbouring villages, then from the more distant territories, and, finally, from the Milanese cities.

The ordinary spectacle of ordinary times, the contrast of magnificent apparel with rags, and of luxury with poverty, had entirely disappeared. The nobility even wore coarse clothing; some, because the general misery had affected their fortune; others, because they would not insult the wretchedness of the people, or because they feared to provoke the general despair by the display of luxury at such a time.

Thus passed the winter and the spring; already had the Tribunal of Health remonstrated with the Tribunal of Provision on the danger to which such mass of misery exposed the city. To prevent contagious diseases, a proposal was made to confine the vagabond beggars in the various hospitals. Whilst this project was under discussion, some approving and others condemning, dead bodies incumbered the streets. The Tribunal of Provision, however, proposed another expedient as more easy and expeditious, which was, to shut up all the mendicants, healthy or diseased, in the lazaretto, and to maintain them there at the expense of the city. This measure was resolved upon, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Tribunal of Health, who objected that, in so numerous an assemblage, the evil to which they wished to apply a remedy would be greatly augmented.

The little order that reigned in the lazaretto, the bad quality of the food, and the standing water which was drank plentifully, soon created numerous maladies. To these causes of mortality, so much the more active from operating on bodies already exhausted or enfeebled, was added the unfavourableness of the season; obstinate rains, followed by more obstinate drought, and violent heat. To these physical evils were added others of a moral nature, despair and wearisomeness in captivity, desire for accustomed habits, regret for cherished beings of whom these unfortunate beings had been deprived; painful apprehension for those who were living, and the continual dread of death, which had itself become a new and powerful cause of the extension of disease. It is not to be wondered at that mortality increased in this species of prison to such a degree as to assume the appearance and deserve the name of pestilence. The number of deaths in the lazaretto soon amounted to a hundred daily.

Whilst within these wretched walls, grief, fear, anguish, and rage prevailed, in the Tribunal of Provision, shame, astonishment, and irresolution were equally apparent. They consulted, and now listened to the advice of the Tribunal of Health: finding they could do no better than to undo what they had done, at so much expense and trouble, they opened the doors of the lazaretto, and released all who were well enough to leave it. The city was thus again filled with its former cries, but feebler, and more interrupted; the sick were transported to Santa Maria della Stella, which was then the hospital for the poor, and the greater part perished there.

However, the fields began to yield the harvest so long desired, and the troops of peasants left the city for their long prayed for and accustomed labours. The ingenious and inexhaustible charity of the good Frederick still exerted itself; he made a present of a giulio[35] and a sickle to each peasant, who solicited it at the palace.

With a plentiful harvest, scarcity ceased to be felt; the mortality, however, continued, in a greater or less degree, until the middle of autumn. It was on the point of ceasing, when a new scourge overwhelmed the city and country.

Many events of high historical importance had occurred in this interval of time. The Cardinal Richelieu, after having taken Rochelle, and made a treaty of peace with England, had proposed, effected by his powerful influence in the councils of the French king, that efficacious aid should be sent to the Duke of Nevers; he had also persuaded the king to lead the expedition in person. Whilst the preparations were in progress, the Count of Nassau, imperial commissary, suggested to the new duke in Mantua the expediency of replacing his states in the hands of Ferdinand; intimating that, in case of refusal, an army would be immediately sent by the emperor to occupy them. The duke, who in the most desperate circumstances had rejected so hard a condition, encouraged now by the promised succours from France, was determined still longer to defend himself. The commissary departed, declaring that force would soon decide the matter.

In the month of March, the Cardinal Richelieu with the king, at the head of an army, demanded a free passage from the Duke of Savoy; he entered into treaties for the purpose, but nothing was concluded. After a rencounter, in which the French obtained the advantage, a new treaty was entered into, in which the duke stipulated that Don Gonzalo de Cordova should raise the siege of Casale, engaging, in case of his refusal, to unite with the French, and invade the duchy of Milan. Don Gonzalo raised the siege of Casale, and a body of French troops entered it, to reinforce the garrison. The Cardinal Richelieu decided to return to France, on business which he regarded as more urgent; but Girolamo Soranzo, envoy from Venice, offered the most powerful reasons to divert him from this resolution. To these the king and the cardinal paid no attention; they returned with the greatest part of the army, leaving only 6000 men at Suza to occupy the passes and maintain the treaty.

Whilst this army departed on one side, that of Ferdinand, commanded by the Count of Collato, advanced on the other. It had invaded the country of the Grisons, and the Valtelline, and was preparing to come down on the Milanese. Besides the usual terrors which such an expectation was calculated to excite, the report was spread, that the plague lurked in the imperial army. Alessandro Tadino, one of the conservators of the public health, was charged by the tribunal to state to the governor the frightful danger which threatened the country, if this army should obtain the pass which opened on Mantua. It appears from all the actions of Gonzalo, that he was possessed by a desire to occupy a great place in history; but, as often happens, history has failed to register one of his most remarkable acts, the answer he returned to this Doctor Tadino; which was, “that he knew not what could be done; that reasons of interest and honour, which had induced the march of the army, were of greater weight than the danger represented; that he would, however, endeavour to act for the best, and that they must trust to Providence.”

In order, then, to act for the best, their two physicians proposed to the tribunal to forbid, under the most severe penalty, the purchase of any articles of clothing from the soldiers who were about to pass. As to Don Gonzalo, his reply to Doctor Tadino was one of his last acts at Milan, as the ill success of the war, which had been instigated and directed by him, caused him to be displaced in the course of the summer. He was succeeded by Marquis Ambrosio Spinola, who had already acquired the military celebrity in the wars of Flanders which still endures.

Meanwhile the German troops had received definite orders to march upon Mantua, and in the month of September they entered the duchy of Milan.

At this epoch armies were composed, for the greater part, of adventurers, enlisted by condottieri, who held their commission from some prince, and who sometimes pursued the occupation on their own account, so as to be able to sell themselves and followers together. Men were drawn to this vocation much less by the pay which was assigned to them, than by the hope of pillage, and the charms of licence. There was no fixed or general discipline; and as their pay was very uncertain, the spoils of the countries which they over-ran were tacitly accorded to them by their commanders.

It was a saying of the celebrated Wallenstein's, that it was easier to maintain an army of 100,000 men than one of 12,000. And this army of which we are now speaking was part of that which in the thirty years' war had desolated all Germany; it was commanded by one of Wallenstein's lieutenants, and consisted of 28,000 infantry, and 7000 horse. In descending from the Valtelline towards Milan, they had to coast along the Adda, to the place where it empties into the Po; eight days' march in the duchy of Milan.

A great proportion of the inhabitants retired to the mountains, carrying with them their most precious possessions; some remained to watch the sick, or to preserve their dwellings from the flames, or to watch the valuable property which they had buried or concealed; and others remained because they had nothing to lose. When the first detachment arrived at the place where they were to halt, the soldiers scattered themselves through the country; and subjected it at once to pillage; all that could be eaten or carried off disappeared; fields were destroyed, and cottages burnt to the ground; every hiding-place, every method to which people had resorted, in their despair, for the defence of their property, became useless, nay, often resulted in the peculiar injury of the proprietor. Strict search was made throughout every house by the soldiers; they easily detected in the gardens the earth which had been newly dug; they penetrated the caverns in search of the opulent inhabitants, who had taken refuge there, and dragging them to their houses, forced them to declare where they had concealed their treasures.

At last they departed; their drums and trumpets were heard receding in the distance, and a temporary calm succeeded to these hours of tumult and affright; but, alas! the sound of drums was again heard, announcing the arrival of another detachment, the soldiers of which, furious at not finding booty, destroyed what the first work of desolation had spared; burned the furniture and the houses, and manifested the most cruel and savage disposition towards the inhabitants. This continued for a period of twenty days, the army containing that number of divisions.

Colico was the first territory of the duchy that these demons invaded; they then threw themselves on Bellano, from which they entered and spread themselves in the Valsassina, whence they marched into the territory of Lecco.
CHAPTER XXIX.

Here, among those who were expecting the arrival of the army in alarm and consternation, we find persons of our acquaintance. He who did not behold Don Abbondio on the day when the report was spread of the descent of the army, of its near approach, and its excesses, can have no idea of the power of fright upon a feeble mind. All sorts of reports were afloat. They are coming—thirty, forty, fifty thousand men. They have sacked Cortenova; burnt Primaluna; plundered Introbbio, Pasturo, Barsio. They have been seen at Balobbio; to-morrow they will be here. Such were the statements in circulation. The villagers assembled in tumultuous crowds, hesitating whether to fly or remain, while the women lamented aloud over their miserable fate.

Don Abbondio, to whom flight had immediately suggested itself, saw in it, nevertheless, invincible obstacles, and frightful dangers. “What shall I do?” cried he; “where shall I go?” The mountains, without speaking of the difficulty of ascending them, were not safe; the foot soldiers climbed them like cats, if they had the slightest indication or hope of booty; the waters of the lake were swollen; it was blowing violently; in addition to which, the greater part of the watermen, fearing to be forced to pass soldiers or baggage, had taken refuge with their boats on the opposite shore; the few barks that remained were already filled with people, and endangered by the weather. It was impossible to find a carriage or horse, or any mode of conveyance. Don Abbondio did not dare venture on foot, incurring, as he would, the probability of being stopped on the road. The confines of the Bergamascan territory were not so distant, but that he could have walked there in a little while; but a report had reached the village, that a squadron of cappelletri had been sent in haste from Bergamo, to guard the frontiers against the German foot-soldiers. These were not less devils incarnate than those they were commissioned to oppose. The poor man was beside himself with terror; he endeavoured to concert with Perpetua some plan of escape, but Perpetua was quite occupied in collecting and concealing his valuables; with her hands full, she replied, “Let me place this in safety; we will then do as other people do.” Don Abbondio desired eagerly to discuss with her the best means to be pursued, but Perpetua, between hurry and fright, was less tractable than usual: “Others will do the best they can,” said she, “and so will we. Excuse me, but you only hinder one. Do you not think they have skins to save as well as we?”

Relieving herself thus from his importunities, she went on with her occupation; the poor man, as a last resource, went to a window, and cried, in a piteous tone, to the people who were passing, “Do your poor curate the favour to bring him a horse or a mule; is it possible no one will come to help me? Wait for me at least; wait till I can go with you; abandon me not. Would you leave me in the power of these dogs? Know you not that they are Lutherans, and that the murder of a priest will seem to them a meritorious deed? Would you leave me here to be martyred?”

But to whom did he address this appeal? to men who were themselves incumbered with the weight of their humble movables, or, disturbed by the thoughts of what they had been obliged to leave behind, exposed to the ravages of the destroyer. One drove his cow before him; another conducted his children, who were also laden with burdens, his wife perhaps with an infant in her arms. Some went on their way without replying or looking at him; others merely said, “Eh, sir, do as you can; you are fortunate in having no family to think of; help yourself; do the best you can.”

“Oh, poor me!” cried Don Abbondio, “oh, what savages! they have no feeling; they give not a thought to their poor curate!” And he went again in search of Perpetua.

“Oh, you are come just in time,” said she, “where is your money?”

“What shall we do with it?”

“Give it to me; I will bury it in the garden with the plate.”

“But——”

“But, but, give it to me; keep a few pence for necessity, and let me manage the rest.”

Don Abbondio obeyed, and drawing his treasure from his strong box, gave it to Perpetua. “I will bury it in the garden, at the foot of the fig-tree,” said she, as she disappeared. She returned in a few moments, with a large basket, full of provisions, and a small one, which was empty; into the latter she put a few articles of clothing for herself and master.

“You must take your breviary with you,” said she.

“But where are we going?”

“Where every one else goes. We will go into the street, and then we shall hear and see what we must do.”

At this moment Agnes entered with a small basket in her hand, and with the air of one about to make an important proposal.

She had decided not to wait the approach of the dangerous guests, alone as she was, and with the gold of the Unknown in her possession; but had remained some time in doubt where to seek an asylum. The residue of the crowns, which in time of famine would have been so great a treasure, was now the principal cause of her anxiety and irresolution; as, under the present circumstances, those who had money were worse off than others; being exposed at the same time to the violence of strangers, and the treachery of their companions. It is true, none knew of the wealth which had thus, as it were, fallen to her from heaven, except Don Abbondio, to whom she had often applied to change a crown, leaving him always some part of it for those more unfortunate than herself. But hidden property, above all, to those not accustomed to such a possession, keeps the possessor in continual suspicion of others. Now, whilst she reflected on the peculiar dangers to which she was exposed, by the very generosity itself of the Unknown, the offer of unlimited service, which had accompanied the gift, suddenly occurred to her recollection. She remembered the descriptions she had heard of his castle, as situated in a high place, where, without the concurrence of the master, none dared venture but the birds of heaven. Resolving to go thither, and reflecting on the means of making herself known to this signor, her thoughts recurred to Don Abbondio, who, since the conversation with the archbishop, had been very particular in his expression of good feeling towards her, as he could at present be, without compromising himself, there being but little probability, from the situation of affairs, that his benevolence would be put to the test. She naturally supposed, that in a time of such consternation, the poor man would be more alarmed than herself, and might acquiesce in her plan; this was, therefore, the purpose of her visit. Finding him alone with Perpetua, she made known her intentions.

“What do you say to it, Perpetua?” asked Don Abbondio.

“I say that it is an inspiration from Heaven, and that we must lose no time, and set off immediately.”

“But then——”

“But then, but then; when we have arrived safely there, we shall be very glad, that's all. It is well known that this signor thinks of nothing now but doing good to others, and he will afford us an asylum with the greatest pleasure. There, on the frontiers, and almost in the sky, the soldiers will not trouble us. But then—but then, we shall have enough to eat, no doubt. On the top of the mountains, the provisions we have here with us would not serve us long.”

“Is it true that he is really converted?”

“Can you doubt it, after all you have seen?”

“And if, after all, we should be voluntarily placing ourselves in prison?”

“What prison? With this trifling, excuse me, we shall never come to any conclusion. Worthy Agnes! your plan is an excellent one.” So saying, she placed the basket on the table, and having passed her arms through the straps, swung it over her shoulders.

“Could we not procure,” said Don Abbondio, “some man to accompany us? Should we encounter some ruffian on the way, what assistance would you be to me?”

“Not done yet! always losing time!” cried Perpetua. “Go then, and look for a man, and you will find every one engaged in his own business, I warrant you. Come, take your breviary, and your hat, and let us be off.”

Don Abbondio was obliged to obey, and they departed. They passed through a small door into the churchyard. Perpetua closed it from custom; not for the security it could now give. Don Abbondio cast a look towards the church,—“It is for the people to guard it,” thought he; “it is their church: let them see to it, if they have the heart.” They took the by-paths through the fields, but were in continual apprehension of encountering some one, who might arrest their progress. They met no one, however; all were employed, either in guarding their houses, or packing their furniture, or travelling, with their moveables, towards the mountains.

Don Abbondio, after many sighs and interjections, began to grumble aloud: he complained of the Duke of Nevers, who could have remained to enjoy himself in France, had he not been determined to be Duke of Mantua, in despite of all the world; of the emperor, and above all, of the governor, whose duty it was to keep this scourge from the country, and not invoke it by his taste for war.

“Let these people be, they cannot help us now,” said Perpetua. “These are your usual chatterings, excuse me, which mean nothing. That which gives me the most uneasiness——”

“What is it?”

Perpetua, who had been leisurely recalling to mind the things which she had so hastily concealed, remembered that she had forgotten such an article, and had not safely deposited such another; that she had left traces which might impart information to the depredators.

“Well done!” cried Don Abbondio, in whom the security he was beginning to feel with regard to his life allowed his anxiety to appear for his property; “well done! Is this what you have been doing? Where were your brains?”

“How!” replied Perpetua, stopping for a moment, and attempting, as far as her load would permit, to place her arms a-kimbo; “do you find fault, when it was yourself who teased me out of my wits, instead of helping me as you ought to have done? I have thought more of my master's goods than my own; and if there is any thing lost, I can't help it, I have done more than my duty.”

Agnes interrupted these disputes by introducing her own troubles: she was obliged to relinquish the hope of seeing her dear Lucy, for some time at least; for she could not expect that Donna Prassede would come into this vicinity under such circumstances. The sight of the well-remembered places through which they were passing increased the anguish of her feelings. Leaving the fields, they had taken the high road, the same which the poor woman had travelled, in re-conducting, for so short a time, her daughter to her home, after having been with her at the tailor's. As they approached the village, “Let us go and visit these worthy people,” said Agnes.

“And rest a little, and eat a mouthful,” said Perpetua, “for I begin to have enough of this basket.”

“On condition that we lose no time, for this is not by any means a journey for amusement,” said Don Abbondio.

They were received with open arms, and cordially welcomed; Agnes, embracing the good hostess, wept bitterly; replying with sobs to the questions her husband and she asked concerning Lucy.

“She is better off than we are,” said Don Abbondio; “she is at Milan, sheltered from danger, far from these horrible scenes.”

“The signor curate and his companions are fugitives, are they not?” said the tailor.

“Yes,” replied, at the same time, Perpetua and her master.

“I sympathise with your misfortunes.”

“We are going to the castle of——”

“That is well thought of; you will be as safe as in Paradise.”

“And are you not afraid here?”

“We are too much off the road. If they should turn out of their way, we shall be warned in time.”

The three travellers decided to take a few hours' rest: as it was the hour of dinner, “Do me the honour,” said the tailor, “to partake of my humble fare.”

Perpetua said she had provisions enough in her basket wherewith to break her fast; after a little ceremony, however, on both sides, they agreed to seat themselves at the dinner table.

The children had joyfully surrounded their old friend Agnes; the tailor ordered one of them to roast some early chestnuts; “and you,” said he to another, “go to the garden, and bring some peaches; all that are ripe. And you,” to a third, “climb the fig-tree, and gather the best figs; it is a business to which you are well accustomed.” As for himself, he left the room to tap a small cask of wine, while his wife went in search of a table-cloth. All being prepared, they seated themselves at the friendly board, if not with unmingled joy, at least with much more satisfaction than they could have anticipated from the events of the morning.

“What does the signor curate say to the disasters of the times? I can fancy I'm reading the history of the Moors in France,” said the tailor.

“What do I say? That even that misfortune might have befallen me,” replied Don Abbondio.

“You have chosen an excellent asylum, however; for none can ascend those heights without the consent of the master. You will find a numerous company there. Many people have already fled thither, and there are fresh arrivals every day.”

“I dare to hope we shall be well received. I know this worthy signor: when I had the honour to be in his company he was all politeness.”

“And,” said Agnes, “he sent me word by his illustrious lordship, that if ever I should need assistance, I had only to apply to him.”

“What a wonderful conversion!” resumed Don Abbondio. “And he perseveres? does he not persevere?”

The tailor spoke at length of the holy life of the Unknown, and said, that after having been the scourge of the country, he had become its best example and benefactor.

“And the people of his household—that band?” asked Don Abbondio, who had heard some contradictory stories concerning them, and did not feel, therefore, quite secure.

“The greater part have left him,” replied the tailor, “and those who have remained have changed their manner of life; in short, this castle has become like the Thebaid. The signor curate understands me.”

Then retracing with Agnes the visit of the cardinal, “What a great man!” said he, “a great man, indeed! what a pity he remained so short a time with us! I wished to do him honour. Oh, if I had only been able to address him again, more at my leisure!”

When they rose from table, he showed them an engraving of the cardinal, which he had hung on the door, from veneration to his virtues, and also to enable him to assure every body that it was no likeness; he knew it was not, as he had regarded him closely at his leisure in this very room.

“Did they mean that for him?” said Agnes. “The habit is the same, but——”

“It is no likeness, is it?” said the tailor; “that is what I always say, but other things being wanting, there is at least his name under it, which tells who it is.”

Don Abbondio being impatient to be gone, the tailor went in search of a vehicle to carry the little company to the foot of the ascent, and returned in a few moments to inform them it was ready. “Signor curate,” said he, “if you wish a few books to carry with you, I can lend you some; for I amuse myself sometimes with reading. They are not like yours, to be sure, being in the vulgar tongue, but——”

“A thousand thanks, but under present circumstances I have scarcely brains enough to read my breviary.”

After an exchange of thanks, invitations, and promises, they bade farewell, and pursued, with a little more tranquillity of mind, the remainder of their journey.

The tailor had told Don Abbondio the truth, with regard to the new life of the Unknown. From the day that we took our leave of him, he had continued to put in practice his good intentions, by repairing injuries, reconciling himself with his enemies, and succouring the distressed and unfortunate. The courage he had formerly evinced in attack and defence he now employed in avoiding all occasion both for the one and the other. He went unarmed and alone; disposed to suffer the possible consequences of the violences he had committed; persuaded that it would be adding to his crimes to employ any methods of defence for himself, as he was a debtor to all the world; and persuaded also, that though the evil done to him would be sin against God, it would be but a just retribution against himself; and that he had left himself no right to revenge an injury, however unprovoked it might be at the time. But he was not less inviolable than when he bore arms to insure his safety; the recollection of his former ferocity, and the contrast of his present gentleness, the former exciting a desire of revenge, and the latter rendering this revenge so easy, conspired to subdue hatred, and, in its place, to substitute an admiration which served him as a safeguard. The man whom no one could humble, but who had humbled himself, was regarded with the deepest veneration. Those whom he had wronged had obtained, beyond their hopes, and without incurring any danger, a satisfaction which they could never have promised themselves from the most complete revenge, the satisfaction of seeing him repent of his wrongs, and participate, so to speak, in their indignation. In his voluntary abasement, his countenance and manner had acquired, without his own knowledge, something elevated and noble; his outward demeanour was as dauntless as ever.

This change, also, in addition to other reasons, secured him from public retribution at the instigation of those in authority. His rank and family, which had always been a species of defence to him, still prevailed in his favour; and to his name, already famous, was joined the personal esteem which was now due to him. The magistrates and nobility had rejoiced at his conversion, as well as the people; as this conversion produced compensations that they were neither accustomed to ask nor obtain. Probably, also, the name of the Cardinal Frederick, whose interest in his conversion, and subsequent friendship for him, were well known, served him as an impenetrable shield.

Upon the arrival of the German troops, when fugitives from the invaded countries fled to the castle, delighted that his walls, so long the object of dread and execration to the feeble, should now be regarded as a place of security and protection, the Unknown received them rather with gratitude than politeness. He caused it to be made public, that his doors would be open to all, and employed himself immediately in placing not only the castle but the valley beneath in a state of defence: assembling the servants who had remained with him, he addressed them on the opportunity God had afforded them, as well as himself, to serve those whom they had so frequently oppressed and terrified. With his old accent of command, expressing the certainty of being obeyed, he gave them general orders, as to their deportment, so that those who should take refuge with him might behold in them only defenders and friends. He gave their arms to them again, of which they had been deprived; as also to the peasants of the valley, who were willing to engage in its defence: he named officers, and appointed to them their duty and their different stations, as he had been accustomed to do in his former criminal life. He himself, however, whether from principle, or that he had made a vow to that effect, remained unarmed at the head of his garrison.

He also employed the females of the household in preparing beds, straw, mattresses, sacks, in various rooms intended as temporary dormitories. He ordered abundant provisions to be brought to the castle for the use of the guests God should send him; and in the mean while he was himself never idle, visiting every post, examining every defence, and maintaining the most perfect order by his authority and his presence.
CHAPTER XXX.

As our fugitives approached the valley, they were joined by many companions in misfortune, who were on the same errand to the castle with themselves: under similar circumstances of distress and anguish, intimacies are soon matured, and they listened to the relation of each other's peril with mutual interest and sympathy; some had fled, like the curate and our females, without waiting the arrival of the troops; others had actually seen them, and could describe, in lively colours, their savage and horrible appearance.

“We are fortunate, indeed,” said Agnes; “let us thank Heaven. We may lose our property, but at least our lives are safe.”

But Don Abbondio could not see so much reason for congratulation; the great concourse of people suggested new causes of alarm. “Oh,” murmured he to the females when no one was near enough to hear him; “oh, do you not perceive that by assembling here in such crowds we shall attract the notice of the soldiery? As every one flies and no one remains at home, they will believe that our treasures are up here, and this belief will lead them hither. Oh, poor me! why was I so thoughtless as to venture here!”

“What should they come here for?” said Perpetua, “they are obliged to pursue their route; and, at all events, where there is danger, it is best to have plenty of company.”

“Company, company, silly woman! don't you know that every lansquenet could devour a hundred of them? and then, if any of them should commit some foolish violence, it would be a fine thing to find ourselves in the midst of a battle! It would have been better to have gone to the mountains. I don't see why they have all been seized with a mania to go to one place. Curse the people! all here; one after the other, like a frightened flock of sheep!”

“As to that,” said Agnes, “they may say the same of us.”

“Hush, hush! it is of no use to talk,” said Don Abbondio; “that which is done, is done: we are here, and here we must remain. May Heaven protect us!”

But his anxiety was much increased by the appearance of a number of armed men at the entrance of the valley. It is impossible to describe his vexation and alarm. “Oh, poor me!” thought he; “I might have expected this from a man of his character. What does he mean to do? Will he declare war? Will he act the part of a sovereign? Oh, poor me! poor me! In this terrible conjuncture he ought to have concealed himself as much as possible; and, behold, he seeks every method to make himself known. It is easy to be seen he wants to provoke them.”

“Do you not see, sir,” said Perpetua, “that these are brave men who are able to defend us? Let the soldiers come; these men are not at all like our poor devils of peasants, who are good for nothing but to use their legs.”

“Be quiet,” replied Don Abbondio, in a low but angry tone, “be quiet; you know not what you say. Pray Heaven that the army may be in haste to proceed on its march, so that they may not gain information of this place being disposed like a garrison. They would ask for nothing better; an assault is mere play to them, and putting every one to the sword like going to a wedding. Oh, poor me! perhaps I can secure a place of safety on one of these precipices. I will never be taken in battle! I will never be taken in battle! I never will!”

“If you are even afraid of being defended——” returned Perpetua; but Don Abbondio sharply interrupted her.

“Be quiet, and take care not to relate this conversation. Remember you must always keep a pleasant countenance here, and appear to approve all that you see.”

At Malanotte they found another company of armed men. Don Abbondio took off his hat and bowed profoundly, saying to himself, “Alas, alas! I am really in a camp.” They here quitted the carriage to ascend the pass on foot, the curate having in haste paid and dismissed the driver. The recollection of his former terrors in this very place increased his present forebodings of evil, by mingling themselves with his reflections, and enfeebling more and more his understanding. Agnes, who had never before trod this path, but who had often pictured it to her imagination, was filled with different but keenly painful remembrances. “Oh, signor curate,” cried she, “when I think how my poor Lucy passed this very road.”

“Will you be quiet, foolish woman?” cried Don Abbondio in her ear. “Are these things to speak of in this place? Are you ignorant that we are on his lands? It is fortunate no one heard you. If you speak in this manner——”

“Oh,” said Agnes, “now that he is a saint——”

“Be quiet,” repeated Don Abbondio: “think you we can tell the saints all that passes through our brains? Think rather of thanking him for the kindness he has done you.”

“Oh, as to that I have already thought of it; do you think I have no manners, no politeness?”

“Politeness, my good woman, does not consist in telling people things they don't like to hear. Have a little discretion, I pray you. Weigh well your words, speak but little, and that only when it is indispensable. There is no danger in silence.”

“You do much worse with all your——” began Perpetua. But “Hush,” said Don Abbondio, and, taking off his hat, he bowed profoundly. The Unknown was coming to meet them, having recognised the curate approaching. “I could have wished,” said he, “to offer you my house on a more agreeable occasion; but, under any circumstances, I esteem myself happy in serving you.”

“Confiding in the great kindness of your illustrious lordship, I have taken the liberty to trouble you at this unhappy time; and, as your illustrious lordship sees, I have also taken the liberty to bring company with me. This is my housekeeper——”

“She is very welcome.”

“And this is a female to whom your lordship has already rendered great benefits. The mother of—of——”

“Of Lucy,” said Agnes.

“Of Lucy!” cried the Unknown, turning to Agnes; “rendered benefits! I! Just God! It is you who render benefits to me by coming hither; to me—to this dwelling. You are very welcome. You bring with you the blessing of Heaven!”

“Oh, I come rather to give you trouble.” Approaching him nearer, she said, in a low voice, “I have to thank you——”

The Unknown interrupted her, asking with much interest concerning Lucy. He then conducted his new guests to the castle. Agnes looked at the curate, as if to say, “See if there is any need of your interfering between us with your advice.”

“Has the army arrived in your parish?” said the Unknown to Don Abbondio.

“No, my lord, I would not wait for the demons. Heaven knows if I should have escaped alive from their hands, and been able to trouble your illustrious lordship!”

“You may be quite at ease; you are now in safety; they will not come here. If the whim should seize them, we are ready to receive them.”

“Let us hope they will not come,” said Don Abbondio. “And on that side,” added he, pointing to the opposite mountains, “on that side, also, wanders another body of troops; but—but——”

“It is true. But, doubt not, we are ready for them also.”

“Between two fires!” thought Don Abbondio, “precisely between two fires! Where have I suffered myself to be led? And by two women! And this lord appears to delight in such business! Oh, what people there are in the world!”

When they entered the castle, the Unknown ordered Agnes and Perpetua to be conducted to a room, in the quarter assigned to the women, which was three of the four wings of the second court, in the most retired part of the edifice. The men were accommodated in the wings of the other court to the right and left; the body of the building was filled, partly with provisions, and partly with the effects that the refugees brought with them. In the quarter devoted to the men was a small apartment destined to the ecclesiastics who might arrive. The Unknown accompanied Don Abbondio thither, who was the first to take possession of it.

Our fugitives remained three or four and twenty days in the castle, in the midst of continual bustle and alarm. Not a day passed without some reports; at each account, the Unknown, unarmed as he was, led his band beyond the precincts of the valley to ascertain the extent of the peril; it was a singular thing, indeed, to behold him, without any personal defence, conducting a body of armed men.

Not to encroach too far on the benevolence of the Unknown, Agnes and Perpetua employed themselves in performing services in the household. These occupations, with occasional conversations with the acquaintances they had formed at the castle, enabled them to pass away the time with less weariness. Poor Don Abbondio, who had nothing to do, was notwithstanding prevented from becoming listless and inactive by his fears: as to the dread of an attack, it was in some measure dissipated, but still the idea of the surrounding country, occupied on every side by soldiers, and of the numerous consequences which might at any moment result from such a state, kept him in perpetual alarm.

All the time he remained in this asylum he never thought of going beyond the defences; his only walk was on the esplanade; he surveyed every side of the castle, observing attentively the hollows and precipices, to ascertain if there were any practicable passage by which he might seek escape in case of imminent danger. Every day there were various reports of the march of the soldiers; some newsmongers by profession gathered greedily all these reports, and spread them among their companions. On such a day, such a regiment arrived in such a territory; the next day they would ravage such another, where, in the mean time, another detachment had been plundering before them. An account was kept of the regiments that passed the bridge of Lecco, as they were then considered fairly out of the country. The cavalry of Wallenstein passed, then the infantry of Marrados, then the cavalry of Anzalt, then the infantry of Brandenburgh, and, finally, that of Galasso. The flying squadron of Venetians also removed, and the country was again free from invaders. Already the inhabitants of the different villages had begun to quit the castle; some departed every day, as after an autumn storm the birds of heaven leave the leafy branches of a great tree, under whose shelter they had sought and obtained protection. Our three friends were the last to depart, as Don Abbondio feared, if he returned so soon to his house, to find there some loitering soldiers. Perpetua in vain repeated, that the longer they delayed, the greater opportunity they afforded to the thieves of the country to take possession of all that might have been left by the spoilers.

On the day fixed for their departure, the Unknown had a carriage ready at Malanotte, and, taking Agnes aside, he made her accept a bag of crowns, to repair the damage she would find at home; although she protested she was in no need of them, having still some of those he had formerly sent her.

“When you see your good Lucy,” said he, “(I am certain that she prays for me, as I have done her much evil,) tell her that I thank her, and that I trust in God that her prayer will return in blessings on herself.”

They finally departed; they stopped for a few moments at the house of the tailor, where they heard sad relations of this terrible march,—the usual story of violence and plunder. The tailor's family, however, had remained unmolested, as the army did not pass that way.

“Ah, signor curate!” said the tailor, as he was bidding him farewell, “here is a fine subject to appear in print!”

After having proceeded a short distance, our travellers beheld melancholy traces of the destruction they had heard related. Vineyards despoiled, not by the vintager, but as if by a tempest; vines trampled under foot; trees wounded and lopped of their branches; hedges destroyed; in the villages, doors broken open, window-frames dashed in, and streets filled with different articles of furniture and clothing, broken and torn to pieces. In the midst of lamentations and tears, the peasants were occupied in repairing, as well as they could, the damage done; while others, overcome by their miseries, remained in a state of silent despair. Having passed through these scenes of complicated woe, they at last succeeded in reaching their own dwellings, where they witnessed the same destruction. Agnes immediately occupied herself in reducing to order the little furniture that was left her, and in repairing the damage done to her doors and windows; but she did not forget to count over in secret her crowns, thanking God in her heart, and her generous benefactor, that in the general overthrow of order and safety she at least had fallen on her feet.

Don Abbondio and Perpetua entered their house without being obliged to have recourse to keys. In addition to the miserable destruction of all their furniture, whose various fragments impeded their entrance, the most horrible odours for a time drove them back; and when these obstacles were at last surmounted, and the rooms were entered, they found indignity added to mischief. Frightful and grotesque figures of priests, with their square caps and bands, were drawn with pieces of coal upon the walls in all sorts of ridiculous attitudes.

“Ah, the hogs!” cried Perpetua.—“Ah, the thieves!” exclaimed Don Abbondio. Hastening into the garden, they approached the fig-tree, and beheld the earth newly turned up, and, to their utter dismay, the tomb was opened, and the dead was gone. Don Abbondio scolded Perpetua for her bad management, who was not slack in repelling his complaints. Both pointing backwards to the unlucky hiding place, at length returned to the house, and set about endeavouring to purify it of some of its accumulated filth, as at such a time it was impossible to procure assistance for the purpose. With money lent them by Agnes, they were in some measure enabled to replace their articles of furniture.

For some time this disaster was the source of continual disputes between Perpetua and her master; the former having discovered that some of the property, which they supposed to have been taken by the soldiers, was actually in possession of certain people of the village, she tormented him incessantly to claim it. There could not have been touched a chord more hateful to Don Abbondio, since the property was in the hands of that class of persons with whom he had it most at heart to live in peace.

“But I don't wish to know these things,” said he. “How many times must I tell you that what has happened has? Must I get myself into trouble again, because my house has been robbed?”

“You would suffer your eyes to be pulled from your head, I verily believe,” said Perpetua; “others hate to be robbed, but you, you seem to like it.”

“This is pretty language to hold, indeed! Will you be quiet?”

Perpetua kept silence, but continually found new pretexts for resuming the conversation; so that the poor man was obliged to suppress every complaint at the loss of such or such a thing, as she would say, “Go and find it at such a person's house, who has it, and who would not have kept it until now if he had not known what kind of a man he had to deal with.”

But here we will leave poor Don Abbondio, having more important things to speak of than his fears, or the misery of a few villagers from a transient disaster like this.
CHAPTER XXXI.

The pestilence, as the Tribunal of Health had feared, did enter the Milanese with the German troops. It is also known that it was not limited to that territory, but that it spread over and desolated a great part of Italy. Our story requires us, at present, to relate the principal circumstances of this great calamity, as far as it affected the Milanese, and principally the city of Milan itself, for the chroniclers of the period confine their relations chiefly to this place. At the same time we cannot avoid giving a general though brief sketch of an event in the history of our country more talked of than understood.

Many partial narratives written at the time are still extant; but these convey but an imperfect view of the subject, historically speaking. It is true they serve to illustrate and confirm one another, and furnish materials for a history; but the history is still wanting. Strange to say, no writer has hitherto attempted to reduce them to order, and exhibit all the various events, public and private acts, causes and conjectures, relative to this calamity, in a concatenated series. Ripamonti's narrative, though far more ample than any other, is still very defective. We shall, therefore, attempt, in the following pages, to present the reader with a succinct, but accurate and continuous, statement of this fatal scourge.

In all the line of country which had been over-run by the army, dead bodies had been found in the houses, as well as on the roads. Soon after, throughout the whole country, entire families were attacked with violent disorders, accompanied with unusual symptoms, which the aged only remembered to have seen at the time of the plague, which, fifty-three years before, had desolated a great part of Italy, and principally the Milanese, where it was and still is known by the name of the Plague of San Carlo. It derives this appellation from the noble, beneficent, and disinterested conduct of that great man, who at length became its victim.

Ludovico Settala, a physician distinguished so long ago as during the former plague, announced to the Tribunal of Health, by the 20th of October, that the contagion had indisputably appeared at Lecco; but no measures were taken upon this report. Further notices of a like import induced them to despatch a commissioner, with a physician of Como, who, most unaccountably, upon the report of an old barber of Bellano, announced that the prevailing disease arose merely from the autumnal exhalation from the marshes, aggravated by the sufferings caused by the passage of the German troops.

Meanwhile, further intelligence of the new disease, and of the number of deaths, arriving from all parts, two commissioners were sent to examine the places where it had appeared, and, if necessary, to use precautions to prevent its increase. The scourge had already spread to such an extent, as to leave no doubt of its character. The commissioners passed through the territories of Lecco, the borders of the lake of Como, the districts of Monte-Brianza, and Gera-d'Adda, and found the villages every where in a state of barricade, or deserted, and the inhabitants flying, or encamped in the middle of the fields, or dispersed abroad throughout the country; “like so many wild creatures,” says Doctor Tadino, one of the envoys, “they were carrying about them some imaginary safeguard against the dreaded disease, such as sprigs of mint, rue, or rosemary, and even vinegar.” Informing themselves of the number of deaths, the commissioners became alarmed, and visiting the sick and the dead, recognised the terrible and infallible evidences of the plague!

Upon this information, orders were given to close the gates of Milan.

The Tribunal of Health, on the 14th of November, directed the commissioners to wait on the governor, in order to represent to him the situation of affairs. He replied, that he was very sorry for it; but that the cares of war were much more pressing: this was the second time he had made the same answer under similar circumstances. Two or three days after, he published a decree, prescribing public rejoicings on the birth of Prince Charles, the first son of Philip IV., without troubling himself with the danger which would result from so great a concourse of people at such a time; just as if things were going on in their ordinary course, and no dreadful evil was hanging over them.

This man was the celebrated Ambrose Spinola, who died a few months after, and during this very war which he had so much at heart,—not in the field, but in his bed, and through grief and vexation at the treatment he experienced from those whose interests he had served. History has loudly extolled his merits; she has been silent upon his base inhumanity in risking the dissemination of that worst of mortal calamities, plague, over a country committed to his trust.

But that which diminishes our astonishment at his indifference is the indifference of the people themselves, of that part of the population which the contagion had not yet reached, but who had so many motives to dread it. The scarcity of the preceding year, the exactions of the army, and the anxiety of mind which had been endured, appeared to them more than sufficient to explain the mortality of the surrounding country. They heard with a smile of incredulity and contempt any who hazarded a word on the danger, or who even mentioned the plague. The same incredulity, the same blindness, the same obstinacy, prevailed in the senate, the council of ten, and in all the judicial bodies. Cardinal Frederick alone enjoined his curates to impress upon the people the importance of declaring every case, and of sequestrating all infected or suspected goods. The Tribunal of Health, prompted by the two physicians, who fully apprehended the danger, did take some tardy measures; but in vain. A proclamation to prevent the entrance of strangers into the city was not published until the 29th of November. This was too late; the plague was already in Milan.

It must be difficult, however interesting, to discover the first cause of a calamity which swept off so many thousands of the inhabitants of the city; but both Tadino and Ripamonti agree that it was brought thither by an Italian soldier in the service of Spain, who had either bought or stolen a quantity of clothes from the German soldiers. He was on a visit to his parents in Milan, when he fell sick, and, being carried to the hospital, died on the fourth day.

The Tribunal of Health condemned the house he had lived in; his clothes and the bed he had occupied in the hospital were consigned to the flames. Two servants and a good friar, who had attended him, fell sick a few days after; but the suspicions from the first entertained of the nature of the malady, and the precautions used, prevented its extension for the present.

But in the house from which the soldier had been taken there were several attacked by the disease; upon which all the inhabitants of it were conducted to the lazaretto, by order of the Tribunal of Health.

The contagion made but little progress during the rest of this year and the beginning of the following. From time to time there were a few persons attacked, but the rarity of the occurrence diminished the suspicion of the plague, and confirmed the multitude in their disbelief of its existence. Added to this, most of the physicians joined with the people in laughing at the unhappy presages and threatening opinions of the smaller number of their brethren: the cases that did occur they pretended to explain upon other grounds; and the account of these cases was seldom presented to the Tribunal of Health. Fear of the lazaretto kept all on the alert; the sick were concealed, and false certificates were obtained from some subaltern officers of health, who were deputed to inspect the dead bodies. Those physicians, who, convinced of the reality of the contagion, proposed precautions against it, were the objects of general animadversion. But the principal objects of execration were Tadino and the senator Settala, who were stigmatised as enemies of their country, men whose best exertions had been directed towards mitigating the severity of the coming mischief. Even the illustrious Settala, the aged father of the senator, whose talents were equalled by his benevolence, was obliged to take refuge in a friend's house from the popular fury, because he had constantly urged the necessity of precautionary measures.

Towards the end of the month of March, at first in the suburb of the eastern gate, then in the rest of the city, deaths, attended by singular symptoms, such as spasms, delirium, livid spots and buboes, began to be more frequent. Sudden deaths, too, were frequent, without any previous illness. The physicians still perversely held out; but the magistracy were aroused. The Tribunal of Health called on them to enforce their directions; to raise the requisite funds for the growing expenses of the lazaretto, as well as the helpless poor. The malady advanced rapidly. In the lazaretto all was confusion, bad arrangement, and anarchy. In their difficulty on this point the Tribunal had recourse to the capuchins, and conjured the father provincial to give them a man capable of governing this region of desolation. He offered them Father Felice Casati, who enjoyed a high reputation for charity, activity, and kindness of disposition, added to great strength of mind, and as a companion to him, Father Michele Pozzobonelli, who, although young, was of a grave and thoughtful character. They were joyfully accepted, and on the 30th of March they entered on their duties. As the crowd in the lazaretto increased, other capuchins joined them, willingly performing every office both of spiritual and of temporal kindness, even the most menial; the Father Felice, indefatigable in his labours, watched with unceasing and parental care over the multitude. He caught the plague, was cured, and resumed his duties even with greater alacrity. Most of his brethren joyfully sacrificed their lives in this cause of afflicted humanity.

Not being able longer to deny the terrible effects of the malady, which had now reached the family of the physician Settala, and was spreading its ravages in many noble families, those medical men who had been incredulous were still unwilling to acknowledge its true cause, which would have been a tacit condemnation of themselves; they therefore imagined one entirely conformable to the prejudices of the time. It was at that period a prevailing opinion in all Europe, that enchanters existed, diabolical operators, who at this time conspired to spread the plague, by the aid of venomous poisons and witchcraft. Similar things had been affirmed and believed in other epidemics; particularly at Milan, in that of the preceding century. Moreover, towards the end of the preceding year, a despatch had arrived from King Philip IV. giving information that four Frenchmen, suspected of spreading poisons and pestilential substances, had escaped from Madrid, and ordering that watch should be kept to ascertain if by chance they had arrived at Milan.

The governor communicated the despatch to the senate, and the Tribunal of Health. It then excited no attention; but when the plague broke out, and was acknowledged by all, this intelligence was remembered, and it served to confirm the vague suspicion of criminal agency: two incidents converted this vague suspicion into conviction of a positive and real conspiracy. Some persons who imagined they saw, on the evening of the 17th of May, individuals rubbing a partition of the cathedral, carried the partition out of the church in the night, together with a great quantity of benches. The president of the senate, with four persons of his tribunal, visited the partition, the benches, and the basins of holy water, and found nothing which confirmed the ridiculous suspicion of poison. However, to satisfy the disturbed imaginations of the populace, it was decided that the partition should be washed and purified. But the incident became a text for conjecture to the people; it was affirmed, that the poisoners had rubbed all the benches and walls of the cathedral, and even the bell-ropes.

The next morning a new and more strange and significant spectacle struck the wondering eyes of the citizens. In all parts of the city the doors of the houses and the walls were plastered with long streaks of whitish yellow dirt, which appeared to have been rubbed on with a sponge. Whether it was a wicked pleasantry to excite more general and thrilling alarm, or that it had been done from the guilty design of increasing the public disorder; whatever was the motive, the fact is so well attested, that it cannot be attributed to imagination. The city, already alarmed, was thrown into the utmost confusion; the owners of houses purified all infected places; strangers were stopped in the streets on suspicion, and conducted to prison, where they underwent long interrogatories which naturally ended in proving none of these absurd and imaginary practices against them. The Tribunal of Health published a decree, offering a reward to whomsoever should discover the author or authors of this attempt; but they did this, as they wrote to the governor, only to satisfy the people and calm their fears,—a weak and dangerous expedient, and calculated to confirm the popular belief.

In the mean time many attributed this story of the poisoned ointment to the revenge of Gonsalvo Fernandez de Cordova; others to Cardinal Richelieu, in order the more easily to get possession of Milan; others again affixed the crime to various Milanese gentlemen.

There were still many who were not persuaded that it was the plague, because if it were, every one infected would die of it; whereas a few recovered. To dissipate every doubt, the Tribunal of Health made use of an expedient conformable to the necessity of the occasion; they made an address to the eyes, such as the spirit of the times suggested. On one of the days of the feast of Pentecost, the inhabitants of the city were accustomed to go to the burying ground of San Gregorio, beyond the eastern gate, in order to pray for the dead in the last plague. Turning the season of devotion into one of amusement, every one was attired in his best; on that day a whole family, among others, had died of the plague. At the hour in which the concourse was most numerous, the dead bodies of this family were, by order of the Tribunal of Health, drawn naked on a carriage towards this same burying ground; so that the crowd might behold for themselves the manifest traces, the hideous impress of the disease. A cry of alarm and horror arose wherever the car passed; their incredulity was at least shaken, but it is probable that the great concourse tended to spread the infection.

Still it was not absolutely the plague; the use of the word was prohibited, it was a pestilential fever, the adjective was preferred to the substantive,—then, not the true plague,—that is to say, the plague, but only in a certain sense,—and further, combined with poison and witchcraft. Such is the absurd trifling with which men seek to blind themselves, wilfully abstaining from a sound exercise of judgment to arrive at the truth.

Meanwhile, as it became from day to day more difficult to raise funds to meet the painful exigencies of circumstances, the council of ten resolved to have recourse to government. They represented, by two deputies, the state of misery and distress of the city, the enormity of the expense, the revenues anticipated, and the taxes withheld in consequence of the general poverty which had been produced by so many causes, and especially by the pillaging of the soldiery. That according to various laws, and a special decree of Charles V., the expense of the plague ought by right to devolve upon government. Finally, they proceeded to make four demands: that the taxes should be suspended; that the chamber should advance funds; that the governor should make known to the king the calamitous state of the city and province; and that the duchy, already exhausted, should be excused from providing quarters for the soldiery. Spinola replied with new regrets and exhortations; declaring himself grieved not to be able to visit Milan in person, in order to employ himself for the preservation of the city, but hoping that the zeal of the magistrates would supply his place: in short, he made evasive answers to all their requests. Afterwards, when the plague was at its height, he transferred, by letters patent, his authority to the high chancellor Ferrer, being, as he said, obliged to devote himself entirely to the cares of the war.

The council of ten then requested the cardinal to order a solemn procession, for the purpose of carrying through the streets the body of San Carlos. The good prelate refused; this confidence in a doubtful means disturbed him, and he feared that, if the effect should not be obtained, confidence would be converted into infidelity, and rebellion against God. He also feared that if there really were poisoners, this procession would be a favourable occasion for their machinations; and if there were not, so great a collection would have a tendency to spread the contagion.

The doors of public edifices and private houses had been again anointed as at first. The news flew from mouth to mouth; the people, influenced by present suffering, and by the imminence of the supposed danger, readily embraced the belief. The idea of subtle instantaneous poison seemed sufficient to explain the violence, and the almost incomprehensible circumstances, of the disease. Add to this the idea of enchantment, and any effect was possible, every objection was rendered feeble, every difficulty was explained. If the effects did not immediately succeed the first attempt, the cause was easy to assign: it had been done by those to whom the art was new; and now that it was brought to perfection, the perpetrators were more confirmed in their infernal resolution. If any one had dared to suggest its having been done in jest, or denied the existence of a dark plot, he would have passed for an obstinate fool, if he did not incur the suspicion of being himself engaged in it. With such persuasions on their minds, all were on the alert to discover the guilty; the most indifferent action excited suspicion, suspicion was changed to certainty, and certainty to rage.

As illustrations of this, Ripamonti cites two examples which fell under his own observation, and such were of daily occurrence.

In the church of St. Antonio, on a day of some great solemnity, an old man, after having prayed for some time on his knees, rose to seat himself, and before doing so, wiped the dust from the bench with his handkerchief. “The old man is poisoning the bench,” cried some women, who beheld the action. The crowd in the church threw themselves upon him, tore his white hair, and after beating him, drew him out half dead, to carry him to prison and to torture. “I saw the unfortunate man,” says Ripamonti; “I never knew the end of his painful story, but at the time I thought he had but a few moments to live.”

The other event occurred the next day; it was as remarkable, but not as fatal. Three young Frenchmen having come to visit Italy, and study its antiquities, had approached the cathedral, and were contemplating it very attentively. Some persons, who were passing by, stopped; a circle was formed around them; they were not lost sight of for a moment, having been recognised as strangers, and especially Frenchmen. As if to assure themselves that the wall was marble, the young artists extended their hands to touch it. This was enough. In a moment they were surrounded, and, with imprecations and blows, dragged to prison. Happily, however, they were proved to be innocent, and released.

These things were not confined to the city; the frenzy was propagated equally with the contagion. The traveller encountered off the high road, the stranger whose habits or appearance were in any respect singular, were judged to be poisoners. At the first intelligence of a new comer, at the cry even of a child, the alarm bell was rung; and the unfortunate persons were assailed with showers of stones, or seized and conducted to prison. And thus the prison itself was, during a certain period, a place of safety.

Meanwhile, the council of ten, not silenced by the refusal of the wise prelate, again urged their request for the procession, which the people seconded by their clamours. The cardinal again resisted, but finding resistance useless, he finally yielded; he did more, he consented that the case which enclosed the relics of San Carlos should be exposed for eight days on the high altar of the cathedral.

The Tribunal of Health and the other authorities did not oppose this proceeding; they only ordained some precautions, which, without obviating the danger, indicated too plainly their apprehensions. They issued severe orders to prevent people from abroad entering the city; and, to insure their execution, commanded the gates to be closed. They also nailed up the condemned houses; “the number of which,” says a contemporary writer, “amounted to about five hundred.”

Three days were employed in preparation; on the 11th of June the procession left the cathedral at daybreak: a long file of people, composed for the most part of women, their faces covered with silk masks, and many of them with bare feet, and clothed in sackcloth, appeared first. The tradesmen came next, preceded by their banners; the societies, in habits of various forms and colours; then the brotherhoods, then the secular clergy, each with the insignia of his rank, and holding a lighted taper in his hand. In the midst, among the brilliant light of the torches, and the resounding echo of the canticles, the case advanced, covered with a rich canopy, and carried alternately by four canons, sumptuously attired. Through the crystal were seen the mortal remains of the saint, clothed in his pontifical robes, and his head covered with a mitre. In his mutilated features might still be distinguished some traces of his former countenance, such as his portraits represent him, and such as some of the spectators remembered to have beheld and honoured. Behind the remains of the holy prelate, and resembling him in merit, birth, and dignity, as well as in person, came the Archbishop Frederick. The rest of the clergy followed him, and with them the magistrates in their robes, then the nobility, some magnificently clothed, as if to do honour to the pomp of the celebration, and others as penitents, in sackcloth and bare-footed, each bearing a torch in his hand. A vast collection of people terminated the procession.

The streets were ornamented as on festival days: the rich sent out their most precious furniture; and thus the fronts of the poorest houses were decorated by their more wealthy neighbours, or at the expense of the public. Here, in the place of hangings, and there, over the hangings themselves, were suspended branches of trees; on all sides hung pictures, inscriptions, devices; on the balconies were displayed vases, rich antiquities, and valuable curiosities; with burning flambeaux at various stations. From many of the windows the sequestrated sick looked out upon the procession, and mingled their prayers with those of the people as they passed. The procession returned to the cathedral about the middle of the day.

But the next day, whilst presumptuous and fanatical assurance had taken possession of every mind, the number of deaths augmented in all parts of the city in a progression so frightful, and in a manner so sudden, that none could avoid confessing the cause to have been the procession itself. However, (astonishing and deplorable power of prejudice!) this effect was not attributed to the assemblage of so many people, and to the increase of fortuitous contact, but to the facility afforded to the poisoners to execute their infernal purposes. But as this opinion could not account for so vast a mortality, and as no traces of strange substances had been discovered on the road of the procession, recourse was had to another invention, admitted by general opinion in Europe—magical and poisoned powders! It was asserted that these powders, scattered profusely in the road, attached themselves to the skirts of the gowns, and to the feet of those who had been on that day barefooted: thus the human mind delights itself with contending against phantoms of its own creating.

The violence of the contagion increased daily; in short, there was hardly a house that was not infected; the number of souls in the lazaretto amounted to 12,000, and sometimes to 16,000. The daily mortality, which had hitherto exceeded 500, soon increased to 1200 and 1500.

We may imagine the agony of the council of ten, on whom rested the weighty burden of providing for the public necessities, and of repairing what was reparable in such a disaster: they had to replace every day, and every day to add to the number of individuals charged with public services of all kinds. Of these individuals there were three remarkable classes; the first was that of the monatti: this appellation, of doubtful origin, was applied to those men who were devoted to the most painful and dangerous employment in times of contagion; the taking of the dead bodies from the houses, from the streets, and from the lazaretto, carrying them to their graves, and burying them; also, bringing the sick to the lazaretto, and burning and purifying suspected or infected objects; the second class was that of the apparitori, whose special function was to precede the funeral cars, ringing a bell to warn passengers to retire; and the third was that of the commissaries, who presided over both the other classes, under the immediate orders of the Tribunal of Health.

It was necessary to keep the lazaretto furnished with medicine, surgeons, food, and all the requisites of an infirmary; and it was also necessary to find and prepare new habitations for new cases. Cabins of wood and straw were hastily constructed in the interior enclosure of the lazaretto; then a second lazaretto, a little beyond, was erected, capable of containing 4000 persons. Two others were ordered, but means, men, and courage failed, and they were never completed: despair and weakness had attained such a point, that the most urgent and painful wants were unprovided for; each day, for example, children, whose mothers had perished of the plague, died from neglect. The Tribunal of Health proposed to found an hospital for these innocent creatures, but could obtain no assistance for the purpose; all supplies were for the army, “because,” said the governor, “it is a time of war, and we must treat the soldiers well.”

Meanwhile the immense ditch which had been dug near the lazaretto was filled with dead bodies; a number still remained without sepulture, as hands were wanting for the work. Without extraordinary aid this calamity must have remained unremedied. The president of the senate addressed himself in tears to the two intrepid friars who governed the lazaretto, and the Father Michele pledged himself to relieve in four days the city of the unburied dead, and to dig, in the course of a week, another ditch sufficient not only for present wants, but even for those which might be anticipated in future. Followed by another friar, and public officers chosen by the president, he went into the country to procure peasants, and partly by the authority of the tribunal, partly by that of his habit, he gathered 200, whom he employed to dig the earth. He then despatched monatti from the lazaretto to collect the dead. At the appointed time his promise was fulfilled.

At one time the lazaretto was left without physicians, and it was only after much trouble and time, and great offers of money and honours, that others could be prevailed on to supply their place. Provisions were often so scarce, as to create apprehensions of starvation, but more than once these necessities were unexpectedly supplied by the charity of individuals. In the midst of the general stupor, or the indifference to the miseries of others, occasioned by personal apprehension, some were found whose hands and hearts had ever been open to the wretched, and others with whom the virtue of benevolence had commenced with the loss of all their terrestrial happiness. So also, amidst the destruction of the flight of so many men charged with watching over and providing for the public safety, others were seen, who, well in body and firm in mind, ever remained faithful at their post, and some even, who, by an admirable self-devotion, sustained with heroic constancy cares to which their duty did not call them.

The most entire self-devotion was especially conspicuous among the clergy; at the lazarettos, in the city, their assistance was always at hand; they were found, wherever there was suffering, always in attendance on the sick and the dying; very often languishing and dying themselves: with spiritual, they bestowed, as far as they could, temporal succour. More than sixty clergymen in the city alone died from the contagion, which was nearly eight out of nine.

Frederick, as might be expected, was an example to all; after having seen all his household perish around him, he was solicited by his family, by the first magistrates, and by the neighbouring princes, to fly the peril, but he rejected their advice and their solicitations with the same firmness which induced him to write to the clergy of his diocese:—“Be disposed to abandon life rather than these sufferers, who are your children, and your family; go with the same joy into the midst of the pestilence, as to a certain reward, since you may, by these means, win many souls to Christ.” He neglected no precaution compatible with his duty: he even gave instructions to his clergy on this point; but he betrayed no anxiety, nor did he even appear to perceive danger, where it was necessary to incur it, in order to do good. He was always with the ecclesiastics, to praise and direct the zealous, and to excite the lukewarm; he visited the lazarettos to console the sick, and encourage those who assisted them; he travelled over the city, carrying aid to the miserable who were sequestered in their houses, stopping at their doors and under their windows, to listen to their complaints, and to give them words of consolation and encouragement. Having thus thrown himself into the midst of the contagion, it was truly wonderful that he never was attacked by it.

In seasons of public calamity, when confusion takes the place of order, we often behold a display of the sublimest virtue, but more frequently, alas! an increase of vice and crime. Instances of the latter were not wanting during the present unhappy period. The profligate, spared by the plague, found in the common confusion, and in the slackening of the restraints of law, new occasions for mischief, and new assurances of impunity. And further, power itself had passed into the hands of the boldest among them. There were scarcely found for the functions of monatti and apparitori any, but those over whom the attraction of rapine and licence had more sway than dread of the contagion. Strict rules had been prescribed to them, and severe penalties threatened for infringing them, which had some power for awhile; but the number of deaths, and the increasing desolation, and the universal alarm, soon relieved them from all superintendence, and they constituted themselves (the monatti in particular) the arbiters of every thing. They entered houses as masters and enemies; and, not to mention their robberies, and the cruel treatment which those unhappy persons experienced whom the plague condemned to their authority, they applied their infected and criminal hands to those in health, threatening to carry them to the lazaretto, unless they purchased their exemption with money. At other times they refused to carry off the dead bodies already in a state of putrefaction, without a high price being paid them; it is even said, that they designedly let fall from their carts infected clothing, in order to propagate the infection from which their wealth was derived. Many ruffians, too, assuming the garb of these wretches, carried on extensive robberies in the houses of the sick, dying, and helpless.

In the same proportion as vice increased, folly increased; the foolish idea was again revived of poisonings; the dread of this fantastic danger beset and tormented the minds of men more than the real and present danger. “While,” says Ripamonti, “the heaps of dead bodies lying before the eyes of the living made the city a vast tomb, there was something more afflicting and hideous still—reciprocal distrust and extravagant suspicion; and this not only between friends, neighbours, and guests; but husbands, wives, and children, became objects of terror to one another, and, horrible to tell! even the domestic board and the nuptial bed were dreaded as snares, as places were poison might be concealed.”

Besides ambition and cupidity, the motives commonly attributed to the poisoners, it was imagined that this action included an indefinable, diabolical voluptuousness of enjoyment, an attractiveness stronger than the will. The ravings of the sick, who accused themselves of that which they had dreaded in others, were considered as so many involuntary revelations, which rendered belief irresistible.

Among the stories recorded of this delirium, there is one which deserves to be related, on account of the extensive credence it obtained.

It was said that on a certain day, a citizen had seen an equipage with six horses stop in the square of the cathedral. Within it was a person of a noble and majestic figure, dark complexion, eyes inflamed, and lips compressed and threatening. The spectator being invited to enter the carriage, complied. After a short circuit, it made a halt before the gate of a magnificent palace. Entering it he beheld mingled scenes of delight and horror, frightful deserts and smiling gardens, dark caverns and magnificent saloons. Phantoms were seated in council. They showed him large boxes of money, telling him he might take as many of them as he chose, provided he would accept at the same time a little vase of poison, and consent to employ it against the citizens. He refused, and in a moment found himself at the place from which he had been taken. This story, generally believed by the people, spread all over Italy. An engraving of it was made in Germany. The Archbishop of Mayence wrote to Cardinal Frederick, asking him what credence might be attached to the prodigies related of Milan. He received for answer, that they were all idle dreams.

The dreams of the learned, if they were not of the same nature as those of the vulgar, did not exceed them in value; the greater part beheld the forerunner and the cause of these calamities, in a comet which appeared in 1628, and in the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Another comet that appeared in June in the same year announced the poisonous anointings. All writings were ransacked that contained any passages respecting poisons; amongst the ancients, Livy was cited, Tacitus, Dionysius, even Homer and Ovid were searched. Among the moderns, Cesalpino, Cardan, Grevino, Salio, Pareo Schenchio, Zachia, and lastly the fatal Delrio, whose Disquisitions on Magic became the text book on such subjects, the future rule, and, in fact, the powerful impulse to horrible and frequent legal murders.

The physicians yielded to the popular belief, and attributed to poison and diabolical conjurations the ordinary symptoms of the malady. Even Tadino himself, one of the most celebrated physicians of his day, who had witnessed the entrance of the disorder, anticipated its ravages, studied its symptoms, and admitted it to be the plague, even he, such is the strange perversity of human reason, drew from all these facts an argument in proof of the dissemination of some subtle poison, by means of ointments. Nor was the enlightened Cardinal Frederick himself altogether uninfected by the general mania. In a small tract of his on the subject in the Ambrosian Library, he says, “Of the mode of compounding and dispensing these ointments, various statements have been made, some of which we hold for true, while others appear imaginary.”

On the other hand, Muratori tells us, that he had met with well-informed persons in Milan, whose ancestors were decidedly convinced of the absurdity of this widely spread and extraordinary error, but whose safety rendered it imperative on them to keep their sentiments on the subject to themselves.

The magistrates employed the little vigilance and resolution which remained to them in searching out the poisoners, and unhappily thought they had detected them. A recital of these and similar cases would form a remarkable feature in the history of jurisprudence. But it is high time we should resume the thread of our story.
CHAPTER XXXII.

One night, towards the end of the month of August, in the very height of the pestilence, Don Roderick returned to his house at Milan, accompanied by his faithful Griso, one of the small number of his servants who still survived. He had just left a company of friends, who were accustomed to assemble together, to banish by debauchery the melancholy of the times; at each meeting there were new guests added, and old ones missing. On that day Don Roderick had been one of the gayest, and, among other subjects of merriment which he introduced, he had made the company laugh at a mock funeral sermon on Count Attilio, who had been carried off by the pestilence a few days before.

After leaving the house where he had held his carousal, he was conscious of an uneasiness, a faintness, a weariness of his limbs, a difficulty of breathing, and an internal heat, which he was ready to attribute to the wine, the late hour, and the influence of the season. He spoke not a word during the whole route. Arriving at his house, he ordered Griso to light him to his chamber. Griso, perceiving the change in his master's countenance, kept at a distance, as, in these dangerous times, every one was obliged to keep for himself, as was said, a medical eye.

“I feel very well, do you see,” said Don Roderick, reading in the features of Griso the thoughts which were passing through his mind,—“I feel very well; but I have drank a little too much. The wine was so fine! With a good sleep all will be well again. I am overcome by sleep. Take away the light; I cannot bear it; it troubles me.”

“It is the effect of the wine, signor,” said Griso, still keeping at a distance; “but go to bed, sleep will do you good.”

“You are right; if I could sleep——  I am well, were it not for the want of sleep. Place the little bell near me, in case I should want something; and be attentive if I ring. But I shall need nothing. Carry away that cursed light,” added he; “it troubles me more than I can tell.”

Griso carried off the light; and, wishing his master a good night, he quitted the apartment as Don Roderick crouched beneath the bed-clothes.

But the bed-clothes weighed upon him like a mountain; throwing them off, he endeavoured to compose himself to sleep; hardly had he closed his eyes when he awoke with a start, as if he had been roused by a blow, and he felt that the pain and fever had increased. He endeavoured to find the cause of his sufferings in the heat of the weather, the wine, and the debauch in which he had just been engaged; but one idea involuntarily mingled itself with all his reflections, an idea at which he had been laughing all the evening with his companions, as it was easier to make it a subject of raillery than to drive it away,—the idea of the plague.

After having struggled a long time, he at last fell asleep, but was tormented by frightful dreams. It appeared to him that he was in a vast church, in the midst of a crowd of people. How he came there he could not tell, nor how the thought to do so could have entered his head, especially at such a time. Looking on those by whom he was surrounded, he perceived them to be lean, livid figures, with wild and glaring eyes; the garments of these hideous creatures fell in shreds from their bodies, and through them might be seen frightful blotches and swellings. He thought he cried, “Give way, you rascals!” as he looked towards the door, which was far, far off, accompanying the cry with a menacing expression of countenance, and wrapping his arms around his body to prevent coming in contact with them, for they seemed to be touching him on every side. But they moved not, nor even seemed to hear him: it appeared to him, however, that some one amongst them, with his elbow, pressed his left side near his heart, where he felt a painful pricking. Trying to withdraw himself from so irksome a situation, he experienced a recurrence of the sensation. Irritated beyond measure, he stretched out his hand for his sword, and, behold, it had glided the whole length of his body, and the hilt of it was pressing him in this very place. Vainly did he endeavour to remove it, every effort only increased his agonies. Agitated and out of breath, he again cried aloud; at the sound, all those wild and hideous phantoms rushed to one side of the church, leaving the pulpit exposed to view, in which stood, with his venerable countenance, his bald head and white beard, Father Christopher. It appeared to Don Roderick that the capuchin, after having looked over the assembly, fixed his eyes upon him, with the same expression as on the well-remembered interview in his castle, and, at the same time, raised his arm, and held it suspended above his head; making an effort to arrest the blow, a cry which struggled in his throat escaped him, and he awoke. He opened his eyes; the light of day, which was already advanced, pressed upon his brain, and imparted as keen an anguish as the torch of the preceding night. Looking around on his bed and his room, he comprehended that it was a dream; the church, the crowd, the friar, all had vanished; but not so the pain in his left side. He was sensible of an agonising and rapid beating of his heart, a buzzing in his ears, an internal heat which consumed him, and a weight and weariness in his limbs greater than when he went to bed. He could not resolve to look at the spot where he felt the pain; but, finally gathering courage to do so, he beheld with horror a hideous tumour of a livid purple.

Don Roderick saw that he was lost. The fear of death took possession of him, and with it came the apprehension, stronger perhaps than the dread of death itself, of becoming the prey of the monatti, and of being thrown into the lazaretto. Endeavouring to think of some means of avoiding this terrible fate, he experienced a confusion and obscurity in his ideas which told him that the moment was fast approaching when he should have no feeling left but of despair. Seizing the bell, he shook it violently. Griso, who was on the watch, appeared immediately; stopping at a distance from the bed, he looked attentively at his master, and became certain of that which he had only conjectured the night before.

“Griso,” said Don Roderick, with difficulty raising himself in his bed, “you have always been my favourite.”

“Yes, my lord.”

“I have always done well by you.”

“The consequence of your goodness.”

“I can trust you, I think. I am ill, Griso.”

“I perceived that you were.”

“If I am cured, I will do still more for you than I have ever yet done.”

Griso made no answer, waiting to see to what this preamble would lead.

“I would not trust any one but you,” resumed Don Roderick; “do me a favour.”

“Command me.”

“Do you know where the surgeon Chiodo lives?”

“I do.”

“He is an honest man, who, if he be well paid, keeps secret the sick. Go to him; tell him I will give him four or six crowns a visit,—more, if he wishes it. Tell him to come here immediately; act with prudence; let no one get knowledge of it.”

“Well thought of,” said Griso; “I will return immediately.”

“First, Griso, give me a little water; I burn with thirst.”

“No, my lord, nothing without the advice of a physician. This is a rapid disease, and there is no time to lose. Be tranquil. In the twinkling of an eye, I will be here with the signor Chiodo.” So saying, he left the room.

Don Roderick followed him in imagination to the house of Chiodo, counted his steps, measured the time. He often looked at his side, but, horror-struck, could only regard it a moment. Continuing to listen intently for the arrival of the surgeon, this effort of attention suspended the sense of suffering, and left him the free exercise of his thoughts. Suddenly he heard a noise of small bells, which appeared to come from some of the apartments, and not from the street. Listening again, he heard it louder, and at the same time a sound of steps. A horrible suspicion darted across his mind. He sat up, listened still more attentively, and heard a sound in the next chamber, as of a chest carefully placed on the floor; he threw his limbs out of bed, so as to be ready to rise; and kept his eyes fastened on the door; it opened, and, behold, two monatti with their diabolical countenances, and cursed liveries, advancing towards the bed, whilst from the half-open door was seen the figure of Griso, awaiting the success of his sordid treachery.

“Ah, infamous traitor! Begone, rascals! Biondino, Carlotto, help! murder!” cried Don Roderick, extending his hand under his pillow for his pistol.

At his very first cry the monatti had rushed towards the bed, and the most active of the two was upon him before he could make another movement; jerking the pistol from his hand, and throwing it on the floor, he forced him to lie down, crying in an accent of rage and mockery, “Ah, scoundrel! against the monatti! against the ministers of the tribunal!”

“Keep him down until we are ready to carry him out,” said the other, as he advanced to a strong box. Griso entered the room, and with him commenced forcing its lock. “Villain!” shouted Don Roderick, struggling to get free: “let me kill this infamous rascal,” said he to the monatti, “and then you may do with me what you will.” He then called again loudly on his other servants, but in vain; the abominable Griso had sent them far away with orders as if from his master, before he himself went to propose this expedition, and a share of its spoils, to the monatti.

“Be quiet, be quiet,” said the man, who held him extended on the bed, to the unhappy Don Roderick; then, turning to those who were taking the booty, he said, “Behave like honest men.”

“You! you!” murmured Don Roderick to Griso, “you! after——  Ah, demon of hell! I may still be cured! I may still be cured!”

Griso spoke not a word, and was careful to avoid looking at his master.

“Hold him tight,” said the other monatto, “he is frantic.”

The unfortunate man, after many violent efforts, became suddenly exhausted; but from time to time was seen to struggle feebly and vainly, for a moment, against his persecutors.

The monatti deposited him on a hand-barrow which had been left in the outer room; one of them returned for the booty, then raising their miserable burden, they carried him off. Griso remained awhile to make a selection of such articles as were valuable and portable; he had been very careful not to touch the monatti, nor be touched by them; but, in his thirst for gain, his prudence forsook him; taking the different articles of his master's dress from off the bed, he shook them, for the purpose of ascertaining if there was money in them.

He had, however, occasion to remember his want of caution the next day; whilst carousing in a tavern, he was seized with a shivering, his eyes grew dim, his strength failed, and he fell lifeless. Abandoned by his companions, he fell into the hands of the monatti, who, after having plundered him, threw him on a car, where he expired, before arriving at the lazaretto to which his master had been carried.

We must leave Don Roderick in this abode of horror, and return to Renzo, whom our readers may remember we left in a manufactory under the name of Antony Rivolta. He remained there five or six months; after which, war being declared between the republic and the King of Spain, and all fear on his account having ceased, Bortolo hastened to bring him back, both because he was attached to him, and because Renzo was a great assistance to the factotum of a manufactory, without the possibility of his ever aspiring to be one himself, on account of his inability to write. Bortolo was a good man, and in the main generous, but, like other men, he had his failings; and as this motive really had a place in his calculations, we have thought it our duty to state it. From this time Renzo continued to work with his cousin. More than once, and especially after having received a letter from Agnes, he felt a desire to turn soldier; and opportunities were not wanting, for at this epoch the republic was in want of recruits. The temptation was the stronger, as there was a talk of invading the Milanese, and it appeared to him that it would be a fine thing to return there as a conqueror, see Lucy again, and have an explanation with her; but Bortolo always diverted him from this resolution. “If they go there,” said he, “they can go without you, and you can go afterwards at your leisure. If they return with broken heads, you will be glad to have been out of the scrape. The Milanese is not a mouthful to be easily swallowed; and then the question, my friend, turns on the power of Spain. Have a little patience. Are you not well here? I know what you will say; but if it is written above that the affair shall succeed, succeed it will, without your committing more follies. Some saint will come to your assistance. Believe me, war is not a trade for you. It needs men expressly trained to the business.”

At other times Renzo thought of returning home in disguise, under a false name, but Bortolo dissuaded him from this project also.

The plague afterwards spreading over all the Milanese, and advancing to the Bergamascan territory——don't be alarmed, reader, our design is not to relate its history; all that we would say is, that Renzo was attacked with it, and recovered. He was at death's door; but his strong constitution repelling the disease, in a few days he was out of danger. With life, the hopes and recollections and projects of life returned with greater vigour than ever; more than ever were his thoughts occupied with his Lucy: what had become of her in these disastrous times? “To be at so short distance from her, and to know nothing concerning her, and to remain, God knows how long, in this uncertainty! and then her vow! I will go myself, I will go and relieve these terrible doubts,” said he. “If she lives, I will find her; I will hear herself explain this promise; I will show her that it is not binding; and I will bring her here, and poor Agnes also, who has always wished me well, and I am sure does so still,—yes, I will go in search of them.”

As soon as he was able to walk, he went in search of Bortolo, who had kept himself shut up in his house, on account of the pestilence. He called to him to come to the window.

“Ah, ah,” said Bortolo, “you have recovered. It is well for you.”

“I have still some weakness in my limbs, as you see, but I am out of danger.”

“Oh, I wish I was on your legs. Formerly, when one said, I am well, it expressed all that could be desired; but now-a-days that is of little consequence. When one can say I am better, that's the word for you!”

Renzo informed his cousin of his determination.

“Go now, and may Heaven bless you,” replied he; “avoid the law as I shall avoid the pestilence; and if it is the will of God, we shall see each other again.”

“Oh, I shall certainly return. If I were only sure of not returning alone! I hope for the best.”

“Well, I join in your hopes; if God wills, we will work, and live together here. Heaven grant you may find me here, and that this devilish disease may have ceased.”

“We shall meet again, we shall meet again, I am sure.”

“I say again, God bless you.”

In a few days Renzo, finding his strength sufficiently restored, prepared for his departure; he put on a girdle in which he placed the fifty crowns sent him by Agnes, together with his own small savings; he took under his arm a small bundle of clothes, and secured in his pocket his certificate of good conduct from his second master; and having armed himself with a good knife, a necessary appendage to an honest man in those days, he commenced his journey towards the end of August, three days after Don Roderick had been carried to the lazaretto. He took the road to Lecco, before venturing into Milan, as he hoped to find Agnes there, and learn from her some little of what he desired so much to know.

The small number of those who had been cured of the plague formed a privileged class amidst the rest of the population; those who had not been attacked by the disease lived in perpetual apprehension of it; they walked about with precaution, with an unquiet air, with a hurried and hesitating step; the former, on the contrary, nearly certain of security (for to have the plague twice was rather a prodigy than a rarity), advanced into the very midst of the pestilence with boldness and unconcern. With such security, tempered, however, by his own peculiar anxieties, and by the spectacle of the misery of a whole people, Renzo travelled towards his village, under a fine sky, and through a beautiful country; meeting on the way, after long intervals of dismal solitude, men more like shadows and wandering phantoms than living beings; or dead bodies about to be consigned to the trench without funeral rites. Towards the middle of the day he stopped in a grove to eat his meat and bread; he was bountifully supplied with fruits from the gardens by the road, for the year was remarkably fertile, the trees along the road were laden with figs, peaches, plums, apples, and other various kinds, with hardly a living creature to gather them.

Towards evening he discovered his village; although prepared for the sight, he felt his heart beat, and he was assailed in a moment by a crowd of painful recollections and harrowing presentiments: a deathlike silence reigned around. His agitation increased as he entered the churchyard, and became hardly supportable at the end of the lane—it was there, where stood the house of Lucy—one only of its inmates could now be there, and the only favour he asked from Heaven was to find Agnes still living; he hoped to find an asylum at her cottage, as he judged truly that his own roust be in ruins.

As he went on he looked attentively before him, fearing, and at the same time hoping, to meet some one from whom he might obtain information. He saw at last a man seated on the ground, leaning against a hedge of jessamines, in the listless attitude of an idiot. He thought it must be the poor simpleton Jervase, who had been employed as a witness in his unsuccessful expedition to the curate's house. But approaching nearer, he recognised it to be Anthony. The disease had affected his mind, as well as his body, so that in every act a slight resemblance to his weak brother might be traced.

“Oh, Tony,” said Renzo, stopping before him, “is it you?” Tony raised his eyes, but not his head.

“Tony, do you not know me?”

“Is it my turn? Is it my turn?” replied he.

“Poor Tony! do you indeed not know me?”

“Is it my turn? Is it my turn?” replied he, with an idiotic smile, and then stood with his mouth open.

Renzo, seeing he could draw nothing from him, passed on still more afflicted than before. Suddenly, at a turn of the path, he beheld advancing towards him a person whom he recognised to be Don Abbondio. His pale countenance and general appearance showed that he also had not escaped the tempest. The curate, seeing a stranger, anxiously examined his person, whose costume was that of Bergamo. At length he recognised Renzo with much surprise.

“Is it he, indeed?” thought he, and raised his hands with a movement of wonder and dismay. His wasted arms seemed trembling in his sleeves, which before could hardly contain them.

Renzo, hastening towards him, bowed profoundly; for, although he had quitted him in anger, he still felt respect for him as his curate.

“You here! you!” cried Don Abbondio.

“Yes, I am here, as you see. Do you know any thing of Lucy?”

“How should I know? nothing is known of her. She is at Milan, if she is still in this world. But you——”

“And Agnes, is she living?”

“Perhaps she is; but who do you think can tell? she is not here. But——”

“Where is she?”

“She has gone to Valsassina, among her relatives at Pasturo; for they say that down there the pestilence has not made such ravages as it has here. But you, I say——”

“I am glad of that. And Father Christopher?”

“He has been gone this long time. But you——”

“I heard that,—but has he not returned?”

“Oh no, we have heard nothing of him. But you——”

“I am sorry for it.”

“But you, I say, what do you do here? For the love of Heaven, have you forgotten that little circumstance of the order for your apprehension?”

“What matters it? people have other things to think of now. I came here to see about my own affairs.”

“There is nothing to see about; there is no one here now. It is the height of rashness in you to venture here, with this little difficulty impending. Listen to an old man who has more prudence than yourself, and who speaks to you from the love he bears you. Depart at once, before any one sees you, return whence you came. Do you think the air of this place good for you? Know you not that they have been here on the search for you?”

“I know it too well, the rascals.”

“But then——”

“But, I tell you, they think no more about it. And he, does he yet live? is he here?”

“I tell you there is no one here; I tell you to think no more of the affairs of this place; I tell you that——”

“I ask you if he is here;”

“Oh, just Heaven! Speak in another manner. Is it possible you still retain so much warmth, after all that has happened?”

“Is he here, or is he not?”

“He is not. But the plague, my son, the plague keeps every one from travelling at present.”

“If the pestilence was all that we need fear—I speak for myself, I have had it, and I fear it not.”

“You had better render thanks to Heaven. And——”

“I do, from the bottom of my heart.”

“And not go in search of other evils, I say. Listen to my advice.”

“You have had it also, sir, if I am not mistaken.”

“That I have, truly! most terrible it was! it is by a miracle I am here; you see how it has left me. I have need of repose to restore my strength; I was beginning to feel a little better. In the name of Heaven, what do you do here? Go away, I beseech you.”

“You always return to your go away. If I ought to go away, I would not have come. You keep saying, What do you come for? what do you come for? Sir, I am come home.”

“Home!”

“Tell me, have there been many deaths here?”

“Many!” cried Don Abbondio; and beginning with Perpetua, he gave a long list of individuals, and even whole families. Renzo expected, it is true, a similar recital; but hearing the names of so many acquaintances, friends, and relations, he was absorbed by his affliction, and could only exclaim, from time to time, “Misery! misery! misery!”

“And it is not yet over,” pursued Don Abbondio. “If those who remain do not listen to reason, and calm the heat of their brains, it will be the end of the world.”

“Do not concern yourself; I do not intend to remain here.”

“Heaven be praised! you talk reason at last. Go at once——”

“Do not trouble yourself about it; the affair belongs to me. I think I have arrived at years of discretion. I hope you will tell no one that you have seen me. You are a priest, and I am one of your flock; you will not betray me?”

“I understand,” said Don Abbondio, angrily, “I understand. You would ruin yourself, and me with you. What you have suffered, what I have suffered, is not sufficient. I understand, I understand.” And continuing to mutter between his teeth, he proceeded on his way.

Renzo, afflicted and disappointed, reflected where he should seek another asylum. In the catalogue of deaths given to him by Don Abbondio, there was a family which had all been carried off by the pestilence, with the exception of a young man nearly of his own age, who had been his companion from infancy. The house was a short distance off, a little beyond the village; he bent his steps thither, to seek the hospitality which it might afford him. On his way he passed his own vineyard. The vines were cut, the wood carried off. Weeds of various kinds and most luxuriant growth, principally of the parasitical order, covered the place, displaying the most brilliant flowers above the loftiest branches of the vines, and obstructing the progress of the miserable owner. The garden beyond presented a similar scene of varied and luxuriant wildness. The house, that had not escaped the visitation of the lansquenets, was deformed with filth, dust, and cobwebs. Poor Renzo turned away with imbittered feelings, and moved slowly onwards to his friend's. It was evening. He found him seated before the door, on a small bench, his arms crossed on his breast, with the air of a man stupified by distress, and suffering from solitude. At the sound of steps he turned, and the twilight and the foliage not permitting him to distinguish objects distinctly, he said, “Are there not others besides me? Did I not do enough yesterday? Leave me in quiet; it will be an act of charity.”

Renzo, not knowing what this meant, called him by name.

“Renzo?” replied he.

“It is indeed,” said Renzo, and they ran towards each other.

“Is it you indeed?” said his friend: “oh, how happy I am to see you! who would have thought it? I took you for one of those persons who torment me daily to help to bury the dead. Know you that I am left alone? alone! alone as a hermit!”

“I know it but too well,” said Renzo. They entered the cottage together, each making numerous enquiries of the other. His friend began to prepare the table for supper; he went out, and returned in a few moments with a pitcher of milk, a little salt meat, and some fruit. They seated themselves at table, at which the polenta was not forgotten, mutually congratulating each other on their interview. An absence of two years, and the circumstances under which they met, revived and added new vigour to their former friendship.

No one, however, could supply the place of Agnes to Renzo, not only on account of the particular affection she bore him, but she alone possessed the key to the solution of all his difficulties. He hesitated awhile whether he had not best go in search of her, as she was not very far off; but recollecting that he knew nothing of the fate of Lucy, he adhered to his first intention of gaining all the information he could concerning her, and carrying the result to her mother. He learnt from his friend, however, many things of which he was ignorant, others were explained which he only knew by halves, with regard to the adventures of Lucy, and the persecutions she had undergone. He was also informed that Don Roderick had left the village, and had not returned. Renzo learnt, moreover, to pronounce the name of Don Ferrante properly; Agnes, it is true, had caused it to be written to him, but Heaven knows how it was written; and the Bergamascan interpreter had given it so strange a sound, that if he had not received some instruction from his friend, probably no one in Milan would have guessed whom he meant, although this was the only clue he had to guide him to Lucy. As far as the law was in question his mind was set at rest. The signor Podestà was dead, and most of the officers; the others were removed, or had other matters too pressing to occupy their attention. He related, in his turn, his own adventures to his friend, receiving in exchange an account of the passage of the army, the pestilence, the poisoners, and the prodigies. “Dreadful as are our afflictions,” said he, as he led him for the night to a little chamber which the epidemic had deprived of its inhabitants, “there is a mournful consolation in speaking of them to our friends.”

At the break of day they both arose, and Renzo prepared to depart. “If all goes well,” said he, “if I find her living—if—I will return. I will go to Pasturo and carry the joyful news to poor Agnes, and then—but if, by a misfortune, which may God avert—then, I know not what I shall do, nor where I shall go; but you will never see me here again.”

As he stood on the threshold of the door, about to resume his journey, he contemplated for a moment, with a mixture of tenderness and anguish, his village, which he had not beheld for so long a time. His friend accompanied him a short distance on his road, and bade him farewell, prognosticating a happy return, and many days of prosperity and enjoyment.

Renzo travelled leisurely, because there was ample time for him to arrive within a short distance of Milan, so as to enter it on the morrow. His journey was without accident, except a repetition of the same wretched scenes that the roads at that time presented. As he had done the day before, he stopped in a grove to make a slight repast, which the generosity of his friend had bestowed on him. Passing through Monza, he saw loaves of bread displayed in the window of a shop; he bought two of them, but the shopkeeper called to him not to enter; stretching out a shovel, on which was a small bowl of vinegar and water, he told him to throw the money into it; then with a pair of tongs he reached the bread to him, which Renzo put in his pocket.

Towards evening he passed through Greco, and quitting the high road, went into the fields in search of some small house where he might pass the night, as he did not wish to stop at an inn. He found a better shelter than he anticipated; perceiving an opening in a hedge which surrounded the yard of a dairy, he entered it boldly. There was no one within: in one corner of it was a barn full of hay, and against the door of it a ladder placed. After looking around, Renzo ascended the ladder, settled himself for the night, and slept profoundly until the break of day. When he awoke, he descended the ladder very cautiously, and proceeded on his way, taking the dome of the cathedral for his polar star. He soon arrived before the walls of Milan near the eastern gate.
CHAPTER XXXIII.

Renzo had heard vague mention made of severe orders, forbidding the entrance of strangers into Milan, without a certificate of health; but these were easily evaded, for Milan had reached a point when such prohibition was useless, even if it could have been put into execution. Whoever ventured there, might rather appear careless of his own life, than dangerous to that of others.

With this conviction, Renzo's design was to attempt a passage at the first gate, and in case of difficulty to wander on the outside of the walls until he should find one easy of access. It would be difficult to say how many gates he thought Milan had.

When he arrived before the ramparts, he looked around him; there was no indication of living being, except on a point of the platform, a thick cloud of dense smoke arising; this was occasioned by clothing, beds, and infected furniture, which were committed to the flames; every where along the ramparts appeared the traces of these melancholy conflagrations.

The weather was close, the air heavy, the sky covered by a thick cloud, or fog, which excluded the sun, without promising rain. The surrounding country was neglected and sterile; all verdure extinct, and not a drop of dew on the dry and withering leaves. The depth, solitude, and silence, so near a large city, increased the gloom of Renzo's thoughts; he proceeded, without being aware of it, to the gate Nuova, which had been hid from his view by a bastion, behind which it was then concealed. A noise of bells, sounding at intervals, mingled with the voices of men, saluted his ear; turning an angle of the bastion, he saw before the gate a sentry-box, and a sentinel leaning on his musket, with a wearied and careless air. Exactly before the opening was a sad obstacle, a hand-barrow, upon which two monatti were extending an unfortunate man, to carry him off; it was the chief of the toll-gatherers, who had just been attacked by the pestilence. Renzo awaited the departure of the convoy, and no one appearing to close the gate, he passed forwards quickly; the sentinel cried out “Holla!” Renzo stopping, showed him a half ducat, which he drew from his pocket; whether he had had the pestilence, or that he feared it less than he loved ducats, he signed to Renzo to throw it to him; seeing it at his feet, he cried, “Go in, quickly,” a permission of which Renzo readily availed himself. He had hardly advanced forty paces when a toll-collector called to him to stop. He pretended not to hear, and passed on. The call was repeated, but in a tone more of anger than of resolution to be obeyed—and this being equally unheeded, the collector shrugged his shoulders and turned back to his room.

Renzo proceeded through the long street opposite the gate which leads to the canal Naviglio, and had advanced some distance into the city without encountering a single individual; at last he saw a man coming towards him, from whom he hoped he might gain some information; he moved towards him, but the man showed signs of alarm at his approach. Renzo, when he was at a little distance, took off his hat, like a polite mountaineer as he was, but the man drew back, and raising a knotty club, armed with a spike, he cried, “Off! off! off!” “Oh! oh!” cried Renzo; he put on his hat, and having no desire for a greeting of this fashion, he turned his back on the discourteous passenger and went on his way.

The citizen retired in an opposite direction, shuddering and looking back in alarm: when he reached home he related how a poisoner had met him with humble and polite manners, but with the air of an infamous impostor, and with a phial of poison or the box of powder (he did not know exactly which) in the lining of his hat, to poison him, if he had not kept him at a distance. “It was unlucky,” said he, “that we were in so private a street; if it had been in the midst of Milan, I would have called the people, and he would have been seized: but alone, it was enough to have saved myself—but who knows what destruction he may not already have effected in the city:”—and years after, when the poisoners were talked of, the poor man maintained the truth of the fact, as “he had had ocular proof.”

Renzo was far from suspecting the danger he had escaped; and, reflecting on this reception, he was more angry than fearful. “This is a bad beginning,” thought he; “my star always seems unpropitious when I enter Milan. To enter is easy enough, but, once here, misfortunes thicken. However—by the help of God—if I find—if I succeed in finding—all will be well.”

The streets were silent and deserted; no human being could he see; a single disfigured corpse met his eye in the channel between the street and the houses. Suddenly he heard a cry, which appeared addressed to him; and he perceived, not far off, on the balcony of a house, a woman, surrounded by a group of children, making a sign to him to approach. As he did so, “O good young man!” said she, “do me the kindness to go to the commissary, and tell him that we are forgotten here. They have nailed up the house as suspected, because my poor husband is dead; and since yesterday morning no one has brought us any thing to eat, and these poor innocents are dying of hunger.”

“Of hunger!” cried Renzo. “Here, here,” said he, drawing the two loaves from his pocket. “Lower something in which I may put them.”

“God reward you! wait a moment,” said the woman, as she went in search of a basket and cord to suspend it.

“As to the commissary, my good woman,” said he, putting the loaves in the basket, “I cannot serve you, because, to tell truth, I am a stranger in Milan, and know nothing of the place. However, if I meet any one a little humane and tractable, to whom I can speak, I will tell him.”

The woman begged him to do so, and gave him the name of the street in which she lived.

“You can also render me a service, without its costing you any thing,” said Renzo. “Can you tell me where there is a nobleman's house in Milan, named ***?”

“I know there is a house of that name, but I do not know where it is. Further on in the city you will probably find some one to direct you. And remember to speak of us.”

“Do not doubt me,” said Renzo, as he passed on.

As he advanced, he heard increasing a sound that had already attracted his attention, whilst stopping to converse with the poor woman; a sound of wheels and horses' feet, with the noise of little bells, and occasionally the cracking of whips and loud cries.

As he reached the square of San Marco, the first objects he saw were two beams erected, with a cord and pulleys. He recognised the horrible instrument of torture! These were placed on all the squares and widest streets, so that the deputies of each quarter of the city, furnished with the most arbitrary power, could subject to them whoever quitted a condemned house, or neglected the ordinances, or by any other act appeared to merit the punishment; it was one of those extreme and inefficacious remedies, which, at this epoch, were so absurdly authorised. Now, whilst Renzo was gazing at this machine, he heard the sounds increasing, and beheld a man appear, ringing a little bell; it was an apparitore, and behind him came two horses, who advanced with difficulty, dragging a car loaded with dead; after this car came another, and another, and another; monatti walked by the side of the horses, urging them on with their whips and with oaths. The bodies were for the most part naked; some were half covered with rags, and heaped one upon another; at each jolt of the wretched vehicles, heads were seen hanging over, the long tresses of women were displayed, arms were loosened and striking against the wheels, thrilling the soul of the spectator with indescribable horror!

The youth stopped at a corner of the square to pray for the unknown dead. A frightful thought passed over his mind. “There, perhaps, there, with them—O God! avert this misfortune! let me not think of it!”

The funeral convoy having passed on, he crossed the square, and reached the Borgo Nuovo by the bridge Marcellino. He perceived a priest standing before a half-open door, in an attitude of attention, as if he were confessing some one. “Here,” said he, “is my man. If a priest, and in the discharge of his duty, has no benevolence, there is none left in the world who has.” When he was at a few paces distance from him, he took off his hat, and made a sign that he wished to speak with him, keeping, however, at a discreet distance, so as not to alarm the good man unnecessarily. Renzo having made his request, was directed to the hotel. “May God watch over you now and for ever!” said Renzo, “and,” added he, “I would ask another favour.” And he mentioned the poor forgotten woman. The worthy man thanked him for affording him the opportunity to bestow help where it was so greatly needed, and bade him farewell.

Renzo found it difficult enough to recollect the various turnings pointed out by the priest, disturbed as his mind was by apprehensions for the issue of his enquiries. An end was about to be put to his doubts and fears; he was to be told, “she is living,” or, “she is dead!” This idea took such powerful possession of his mind, that at this moment, he would rather have remained in his former ignorance, and have been at the commencement of the journey, to the end of which he so nearly approached. He gathered courage, however. “Ah!” cried he, “if I play the child now, how will it end!” Plunging therefore into the heart of the city, he soon reached one of its most desolated quarters, that which is called the Carrobio di Porta Nuova. The fury of the contagion here, and the infection from the scattered bodies, had been so great, that those who had survived had been obliged to fly: so that, whilst the passenger was struck with the aspect of solitude and death, his senses were painfully affected by the traces of recent life. Renzo hastened on, hoping to find an improvement in the scene, before he should arrive at the end of his journey. In fact, he soon reached what might still be called the city of the living, but, alas! what living! Every door was closed from distrust and terror, except such as had been left open by the flight of the inhabitants, or by the monatti; some were nailed on the outside, because there were within people dead, or dying of the pestilence; others were marked with a cross, for the purpose of informing the monatti that their services were required, and much of this was done more by chance than otherwise; as a commissary of health happened to be in one spot rather than in another, and chose to enforce the regulations. On every side were seen infected rags and bandages, clothes and sheets, which had been thrown from the windows; dead bodies which had been left in the streets until a car should pass to take them up, or which had fallen from the cars themselves, or been thrown from the houses; so much bad the long duration and the violence of the pest brutalised men's minds, and subdued every spark of human feeling or sympathy. The customary sounds of human occupation or pleasure had ceased; and this silence of death was interrupted only by the funeral cars, the lamentations of the sick, the shrieks of the frantic, or the vociferations of the monatti.

At the break of day, at noon, and at night, a bell of the cathedral gave the signal for reciting certain prayers, which had been ordered by the archbishop, and this was followed by the bells of the other churches. Then persons were seen at the windows, and a confused blending of voices and groans was heard, which inspired a sorrow, not however unmixed with consolation. It is probable that at this time not less than two thirds of the inhabitants had died, and of the remainder many were sick or had left the city. Every one you met exhibited signs of the dreadful calamity. The usual dress was changed of every order of persons. The cloak of the gentleman, the robe of the priest, the cowl of the monk, in short, every loose appendage of dress that might occasion contact, was carefully dismissed; every thing was as close on the person as possible. Men's beards and hair were alike neglected, from fear of treachery on the part of the barbers. Every man walked with a stick, or even a pistol, to prevent the approach of others. Equal care was shown in keeping the middle of the street to avoid what might be thrown from windows, and in avoiding the noxious matters in the road. But if the aspect of the uninfected was appalling, how shall we describe the condition of the wretched sick in the street, tottering or falling to rise no more—beggars, children, women.

Renzo had travelled far on his way, through the midst of this desolation, when he heard a confused noise, in which was distinguishable the horrible and accustomed tinkling of bells.

At the entrance of one of the most spacious streets, he perceived four cars standing; monatti were seen entering houses, coming forth with burthens on their shoulders, and laying them on the cars; some were clothed in their red dress, others without any distinctive mark, but the greater number with a mark, more revolting still than their customary dress,—plumes of various colours, which they wore with an air of triumph in the midst of the public mourning, and whilst people from the different windows around were calling to them to remove the dead. Renzo avoided, as much as possible, the view of the horrid spectacle; but his attention was soon attracted by an object of singular interest; a female, whose aspect won the regards of every beholder, came out of one of the houses, and approached the cars. In her features was seen beauty, veiled and clouded, but not destroyed, by the mortal debility which seemed to oppress her; the soft and majestic beauty which shines in the Lombard blood. Her step was feeble, but decided; she wept not, although there were traces of tears on her countenance. There was a tranquillity and profundity in her grief, which absorbed all her powers. But it was not her appearance alone which excited compassion in hearts nearly closed to every human feeling; she held in her arms a young girl about nine years of age, dead, but dressed with careful precision; her hair divided smoothly on her pale forehead, and clothed in a robe of the purest white. She was not lying, but was seated, on the arm of the lady, her head leaning on her shoulder; you would have thought she breathed, if a little white hand had not hung down with inanimate weight, and her head reposed on the shoulder of her mother, with an abandonment more decided than that of sleep. Of her mother! it was indeed her mother! If the resemblance of their features had not told it, you would have known it by the expression of that fair and lovely countenance!

A hideous monatto approached the lady, and with unusual respect offered to relieve her of her burthen. “No,” said she, with an appearance neither of anger nor disgust, “do not touch her yet; it is I who must place her on the car. Take this,” and she dropped a purse into the hands of the monatto; “promise me not to touch a hair of her head, nor to let others do it, and bury her thus.”

The monatto placed his hand on his heart, and respectfully prepared a place on the car for the infant dead. The lady, after having kissed her forehead, placed her on it, as carefully as if it were a couch, spread over her a white cloth, and took a last look; “Farewell! Cecilia! rest in peace! To-night we will come to you, and then we shall be separated no more!” Turning again to the monatto, “As you pass to-night,” said she, “you will come for me; and not for me only!”

She returned into the house, and a moment after appeared at a window, holding in her arms another cherished child, who was still living, but with the stamp of death on her countenance. She contemplated the unworthy obsequies of Cecilia, until the car disappeared from her eyes, and then left the window with her mournful burthen. And what remained for them, but to die together, as the flower which proudly lifts its head, falls with the bud, under the desolating scythe which levels every herb of the field.

“O God!” cried Renzo, “save her! protect her! her and this innocent creature! they have suffered enough! they have suffered enough!”

He then proceeded on his way, filled with emotions of distress and pity. Another convoy of wretched victims encountered him at a cross street on their way to the lazaretto. Some were imploring to be allowed to die on their own beds in peace; some moving on with imbecile apathy, women as usual with their little ones, and even some of these supported and encouraged with manly devotion by their brothers a little older than themselves, and whom alone the plague had for a time spared for this affecting office. When the miserable crowd had nearly passed, he addressed a commissary whose aspect was a little less savage than the rest; and enquired of him the street and the house of Don Ferrante. He replied, “The first street to the right, the last hotel to the left.”

The young man hastened thither, with new and deeper trouble at his heart. Easily distinguishing the house, he approached the door, raised his hand to the knocker, and held it suspended awhile, before he could summon resolution to knock.

At the sound, a window was half opened, and a female appeared at it, looking towards the door with a countenance which appeared to ask, “Is it monatti? thieves? or poisoners?”

“Signora,” said Renzo, but in a tremulous voice, “is there not here in service a young villager of the name of Lucy?”

“She is no longer here; begone,” replied the woman, about to close the window.

“A moment, I beseech you. She is no longer here! Where is she?”

“At the lazaretto.”

“A moment, for the love of Heaven! With the pestilence?”

“Yes. It is something very uncommon, is it not? Begone then.”

“Wait an instant. Was she very ill? Is it long since?”

But this time the window was closed entirely.

“Oh! signora, signora! one word, for charity! Alas! alas! one word!” But he might as well have talked to the wind.

Afflicted by this intelligence, and vexed with the rude treatment of the woman, Renzo seized the knocker again, and raised it for the purpose of striking. In his distress, he turned to look at the neighbouring houses, with the hope of seeing some one, who would give him more satisfactory information. But the only person he discovered, was a woman, about twenty paces off, who, with an appearance of terror, anger, and impatience, was making signs to some one to approach; and this she did, as if not wishing to attract Renzo's notice. Perceiving him looking at her, she shuddered with horror.

“What the devil!” said Renzo, threatening her with his fist, but she, having lost the hope of his being seized unexpectedly, cried aloud, “A poisoner! catch him! catch him! stop the poisoner!”

“Who? I! old sorceress! be silent,” cried Renzo, as he approached her in order to compel her to be so. But he soon perceived that it was best to think of himself, as the cry of the woman had gathered people from every quarter; not in so great numbers as would have been seen three months before under similar circumstances, but still many more than one man could resist. At this moment, the window was again opened, and the same discourteous woman appeared at it, crying, “Seize him, seize him; he must be one of the rascals who wander about to poison the doors of people.”

Renzo determined in an instant that it was better to fly than to stop to justify himself. Rapidly casting his eyes around to see on which side there were the fewest people, and fighting his way through those that opposed him, he soon freed himself from their clutches.

The street was deserted before him; but behind him the terrible cry still resounded, “Seize him! stop him! a poisoner!” It gained on him, steps were close at his heels. His anger became rage; his agony, despair; drawing his knife from his pocket, and brandishing it in the air, he turned, crying aloud, “Let him who dares come here, the rascal, and I will poison him indeed with this.”

But he saw, with astonishment and pleasure, that his persecutors had already stopped, as if some obstacle opposed their path; and were making frantic gestures to persons beyond him. Turning again, he beheld a car approaching, and even a file of cars with their usual accompaniments. Beyond them was another little band of people prepared to seize the poisoner, but prevented by the same obstacle. Seeing himself thus between two fires, it occurred to Renzo, that that which was an object of terror to these people, might be to him a source of safety. Reflecting that this was not a moment for fastidious scruples, he advanced towards the cars, passed the first, and perceiving in the second a space large enough to receive him, threw himself into it.

“Bravo! bravo!” cried the monatti with one shout. Some of them were following the convoy on foot, others were seated on the cars, others on the dead bodies, drinking from an enormous flagon, which they passed around. “Bravo! that was well done!”

“You have placed yourself under the protection of the monatti; you are as safe as if you were in a church,” said one, who was seated on the car into which Renzo had thrown himself.

The enemy was obliged to retreat, crying, however, “Seize him! seize him! he is a poisoner!”

“Let me silence them!” said the monatto; and drawing from one of the dead bodies a dirty rag, he tied it up in a bundle, and made a gesture as if intending to throw it among them, crying, “Here, rascals!” At the sight, all fled away in horror!

A howl of triumph arose from the monatti.

“Ah! ah! you see we can protect honest people,” said the monatto to Renzo, “one of us is worth a hundred of those cowards.”

“I owe my life to you,” said Renzo, “and I thank you sincerely.”

“'Tis a trifle, a trifle; you deserve it; 'tis plain to be seen you're a brave fellow; you do well to poison this rabble; extirpate the fools, who, as a reward for the life we lead, say, that the plague once over, they will hang us all. They must all be finished, before the plague ceases; the monatti alone must remain to sing for victory, and to feast in Milan.”

“Life to the pestilence, and death to the rabble!” cried another, putting the flagon to his mouth, from which he drank freely, and then offered it to Renzo, saying, “Drink to our health.”

“I wish it to you all,” said Renzo, “but I am not thirsty, and do not want to drink now.”

“You have been terribly frightened, it seems,” said the monatto; “you appear to be a harmless sort of a person; you should have another face than that for a poisoner.”

“Give me a drop,” said a monatto, who walked by the side of the cars; “I would drink to the health of the nobleman, who is here in such good company—in yonder carriage!” And with a malignant laugh he pointed to the car in which poor Renzo was seated. Then brutally composing his features to an expression of gravity, he bowed profoundly, saying, “Will you permit, my dear master, a poor devil of a monatto to taste a little wine from your cellar? Do now, because we lead rough lives, and moreover, we are doing you the favour to take you a ride into the country. And besides, you are not accustomed to wine, and it might harm your lordship; but the poor monatti have good stomachs.”

His companions laughed loudly; he took the flagon, and before he drank, turned again to Renzo, and with an air of insulting compassion said, “The devil with whom you have made a compact, must be very young; if we had not saved you, you would have been none the better for his assistance.”

His companions laughed louder than before, and he applied the flagon to his lips.

“Leave some for us! some for us!” cried those from the forward car. After having taken as much as he wanted, he returned the flagon to his companions, who passed it on; the last of the company having emptied it, threw it on the pavement, crying, “Long live the pestilence!” Then they commenced singing a lewd song, in which they were accompanied by all the voices of the horrible choir. This infernal music, blended with the tingling of the bells, the noise of the wheels, and of the horses' feet, resounded in the empty silence of the streets, echoed through the houses, wringing the hearts of the very few who still inhabited them!

But the danger of the preceding moment had rendered more than tolerable to Renzo, the company of these wretches and the dead they were about to inter; and even this music was almost agreeable to his ears, as it relieved him from the embarrassment of such conversation. He returned thanks to Providence for having enabled him to escape from his peril, without receiving or doing an injury; and he prayed God to help him now to deliver himself from his liberators. He kept on the watch to seize the first opportunity of quietly quitting the car, without exciting the opposition of his protectors.

At last they reached the lazaretto. At the appearance of a commissary, one of the two monatti who were on the car with Renzo jumped to the ground, in order to speak with him: Renzo hastily quitting the ear, said to the other, “I thank you for your kindness; God reward you.”

“Go, go, poor poisoner,” replied he, “it will not be you who will destroy Milan!”

Fortunately no one heard him. Renzo hastened onwards by the wall, crossed the bridge, passed the convent of the capuchins, and then perceived the angle of the lazaretto. In front of the inclosure a horrible scene presented itself to his view. Arrived in front of the lazaretto, throngs of sick were pressing into the avenues which led to the building; some were seated or lying in the ditch, which bordered the road on either side, their strength not having sufficed to enable them to reach their asylum, or who, having quitted it in desperation, were too weak to go further; others wandered by themselves, stupified, and insensible to their condition; one was quite animated, relating his imaginations to a miserable companion, who was stretched on the ground, oppressed by suffering; another was furious from despair; a third, more horrible still! was singing, in a voice above all the rest, and with heart-rending hilarity, one of the popular songs of love, gay and playful, which the Milanese call villanelle.

Already weary, and confounded at the view of so much misery concentrated within so small a space, our poor Renzo reached the gate of the lazaretto. He crossed the threshold, and stood for a moment motionless under the portico.
CHAPTER XXXIV.

The reader may imagine the lazaretto, peopled with sixteen thousand persons infected with the plague: the vast enclosure was encumbered with cabins, tents, cars, and human beings. Two long ranges of porticoes, to the right and left, were crowded with the dying or the dead, extended upon straw; and from the immense receptacle of woe, was heard a deep murmur, similar to the distant voice of the waves, agitated by a tempest.

Renzo went forward from hut to hut, carefully examining every countenance he could discern within—whether broken down by suffering, distorted by spasm, or fixed in death. Hitherto he met none but men, and judged, therefore, that the women were distributed in some other part of the inclosure. The state of the atmosphere seemed to add to the horror of the scene: a dense and dark fog involved all things. The disc of the sun, as if seen through a veil, shed a feeble light in its own part of the sky, but darted down a heavy deathlike blast of heat: a confused murmuring of distant thunder might be heard. Not a leaf moved, not a bird was seen—save the swallow only, which descended to the plain, and, alarmed at the dismal sounds around, remounted the air, and disappeared. Nature seemed at war with human existence—hundreds seemed to grow worse—the last struggle more afflictive—and no hour of bitterness was comparable to that.

Renzo had, in his search, witnessed, as he thought, every variety of human suffering. But a new sound caught his ear—a compound of children's crying and goats' bleating: looking through an opening of the boards of a hut, he saw children, infants, lying upon sheets or quilts upon the floor, and nurses attending them; but the most singular part of the spectacle, was a number of she-goats supplying the maternal functions, and with all the appearance of conscious sympathy hastening, at the cries of the helpless little ones, to afford them the requisite nutrition. The women were aiding these efficient coadjutors, in rendering their supplies available to the poor bereft babies. Whilst observing this wretched scene, an old capuchin entered with two infants, just taken from their lifeless mother, to seek among the flock for one to supply her place. Quitting this spot, and looking about on every side, a sudden apparition struck his sight, and set his thoughts in commotion. He saw at some distance, among the tents, a capuchin, whom he instantly recognised to be Father Christopher!

The history of the good friar, from the moment in which we lost sight of him until this meeting, may be related in few words. He had not stirred from Rimini, and he would not now have thought of doing so if the plague breaking out at Milan had not afforded him the opportunity, so long desired, of sacrificing his life for the benefit of others. He demanded, as a favour, permission to go and assist those who were infected with the disease. The count, he of the secret council, was dead; and moreover, at this time, there was a greater want of guardians to the sick, than of politicians: his request was readily granted. He had now been in the lazaretto nearly three months.

But the joy of Renzo at seeing the good father was not unalloyed. It was he indeed; but, alas! how changed! how wan! Exhausted nature appeared to be sustained for a while by the mind, that had acquired new vigour from the perpetual demand on its sympathies and activity.

“Oh, Father Christopher!” said Renzo, when he was near enough to speak to him.

“You here!” said the friar, rising.

“How are you, my father, how are you?”

“Better than these unfortunate beings that you see,” replied the friar. His voice was feeble—hollow and changed as his person. His eye alone “had not lost its original brightness”—benevolence and charity appeared to have imparted to it a lustre superior to that which bodily weakness was gradually extinguishing.

“But you,” pursued he, “why are you here? Why do you thus come to brave the pestilence?”

“I have had it, thank Heaven! I come——in search of——Lucy.”

“Lucy! Is Lucy here?”

“Yes. At least I hope so.”

“Is she thy wife?”

“My dear father! alas! no, she is not my wife. Do you know nothing, then, of what has happened?”

“No, my son. Since God removed me from you, I have heard nothing. But now that he sends you to me, I wish much to know. And your banishment?”

“You know, then, what they did to me?”

“But you, what did you do?”

“My father, if I were to say I was prudent on that day at Milan, I should tell a falsehood; but I committed no bad action wilfully.”

“I believe you; I have always thought so.”

“Now then I will tell you all.”

“Wait a moment.”

He approached a cabin, and called “Father Victor.”

In a few moments a young capuchin appeared. “Do me the favour, Father Victor,” said he, “to take my place in watching over our poor patients for a little while. If, however, any should particularly ask for me, be so good as to call me.”

The young friar complied, and Father Christopher, turning to Renzo, “Let us enter here,” said he. “But,” added he, “you appear much exhausted, you have need of food.”

“It is true. Now that you make me think of it, I have not tasted any thing to-day.”

“Wait, then, a moment.” He soon brought Renzo a bowl of broth, from a large kettle, the common property of the establishment, and making him sit down on his bed, the only seat his cabin afforded, and placing some wine on a little table by his side, he seated himself next him. “Now tell me about my poor child,” said he, “and be in haste, for time is precious, and I have much to do, as you perceive.”

Renzo related the history of Lucy; that she had been sheltered in the convent of Monza, and carried off from her asylum. At the idea of such treatment and peril, and at the thought, too, that it was he who had unwittingly exposed her to it, the good friar was breathless with attention; but he recovered his tranquillity when he heard of her miraculous deliverance, her restoration to her mother, and her having been placed under the protection of Donna Prassede.

Renzo then briefly related his journey to Milan, his flight, and his return home; that he had not found Agnes there; and at Milan had learned that Lucy was in the lazaretto. “And I am here,” concluded he, “I am here in search of her; to see if she yet lives, and if—— she still thinks of me——because——sometimes——”

“But what direction did they give you? Did they tell you where she was placed when she came here?”

“I know nothing, dear father, nothing; only that she is here, if she still lives, which may God grant!”

“Oh, poor child! But what have you done here until now?”

“I have searched, and searched, but have seen hardly any but men. I think the females must be in another part by themselves; you can tell me if this is the case?”

“Know you not that it is forbidden to men to enter there unless their duty calls them?”

“Oh, well! what can happen to me if I should attempt?”

“The law is a good one, my dear son; and if our weight of affliction does not permit us to enforce it, is that a reason why an honest man should infringe it?”

“But, Father Christopher, Lucy should have been my wife; you know how we have been separated; it is twenty months since I have suffered, and taken my misfortunes patiently; I have come here, risking every thing to behold her, and now——”

“I know not what to say,” resumed the friar; “you are, no doubt, guided by a praiseworthy motive; would to God that all those who have free access to these places conducted themselves as well as I am sure you will. God, who certainly blesses thy perseverance of affection, thy fidelity in desiring and seeking her whom he has given thee, God, who is more rigorous than man, but also more indulgent, will not regard what may be irregular in this enquiry for one so dear.”

So saying, he arose, and Renzo followed him. While listening to him, he had been confirmed in his resolution not to acquaint the father with Lucy's vow. “If he learns that,” thought he, “he will certainly raise new difficulties. Either I shall find her, and we can then disclose, or——and then——what use would it be?”

After having conducted him to the opening of the cabin, towards the north, “From yonder little temple,” said he, “rising above the miserable tents, Father Felix is about to lead in procession the small remnant who are convalescent, to another station, to finish their quarantine. Avoid notice, but watch them as they pass. If she is not of the number, this side,” added he, pointing to the edifice before them, “this side of the building and a part of the field before it are assigned to the women. You will perceive a railing which divides that quarter from this, but so broken, in many places, that you can easily pass through. Once there, if you do nothing to offend, probably no one will speak to you. If, however, there is any difficulty, say that Father Christopher knows you, and will answer for you. Seek her, then, seek her with confidence—and with resignation; for remember, it is an unusual expectation, a person alive within the walls of the lazaretto! Go, then, and be prepared for whatever result——”

“Yes, I understand!” said Renzo, a dark cloud overshadowing his countenance; “I understand, I will seek in every place, from one end of the lazaretto to the other——And if I do not find her!”

“If you do not find her?” repeated the father, in a serious and admonitory tone.

But Renzo, giving vent to the wrath which had been for some time pent up in his bosom, pursued, “If I do not find her, I will find another person. Either at Milan, or in his abominable palace, or at the end of the world, or in the house of the devil, I will find the villain who separated us; but for whom Lucy would have been mine twenty months ago; and if we had been destined to die, at least we should have died together. If he still lives, I will find him——”

“Renzo!” said the friar, seizing him by the arm, and looking at him severely.

“And if I find him,” continued Renzo, entirely blinded by rage, “if the pestilence has not already done justice—the time is past when a poltroon, surrounded by bravoes, can reduce men to despair, and laugh at them! the time is come when men meet face to face, and I will do myself justice.”

“Unhappy youth!” cried Father Christopher, with a voice which had suddenly become strong and sonorous, his head raised, and eyes darting forth more than their wonted fire; “unhappy youth! look around you! Behold who punishes and who judges; who punishes and pardons! But you, feeble worm, you would do yourself justice! Do you know what justice is? Unhappy youth! begone! I hoped——yes, I hoped that before I died, God would afford me the consolation to learn that my poor Lucy still lived; to see her, perhaps, and to hear her promise that she would send a prayer to yonder grave where I shall rest. Begone, you have taken away my hope. God has not left her on the earth for thee, and you certainly have not the audacity to believe yourself worthy that God should think of consoling you. Go, I have no time to listen to you farther.” And he dropped the arm of Renzo, which he had grasped, and moved towards a cabin.

“Oh, my father!” said Renzo, following him with a supplicating look, “will you send me away thus?”

“How!” resumed the capuchin, but in a gentler tone, “would you dare ask me to steal the time from these poor afflicted ones, who are expecting me to speak to them of the pardon of God, in order to listen to thy accents of rage—thy projects of vengeance? I listened to you, when you asked consolation and advice, but now that you have revenge in your heart, what do you want with me? Begone, I have listened to the forgiveness of the injured, and the repentance of the aggressor; I have wept with both; but what have I to do with thee?”

“Oh, I pardon him! I pardon him! I pardon him for ever!” said the young man.

“Renzo,” said the friar, in a calmer tone, “think of it, and tell me how often you have pardoned him?”

He kept silence some time, and not receiving an answer, he bowed his head, and, with a voice trembling from emotion, continued, “You know why I wear this habit?”

Renzo hesitated.

“You know it?” repeated the old man.

“I know it.”

“I likewise hated, I, who have reprimanded you for a thought, a word. The man I hated, I killed.”

“Yes, but it was a noble, one of those——”

“Silence!” interrupted the friar. “If that were justification, believe you I should not have found it in thirty years? Ah! if I could now make you experience the sentiment I have since had, and that I now have for the man I hated! If I could I!—but God can. May he do it! Hear me, Renzo. He is a better friend to you, than you are to yourself; you have thought of revenge, but He has power enough, pity enough, to prevent it; you know you have often said that he can arrest the arm of the powerful; but learn, also, that he can arrest that of the vindictive. And because you are poor, because you are injured, can he not defend against you a man created in his image? Will he suffer you to do all you wish? No! but he can cast you off for ever; he can, for this sentiment which animates you, embitter your whole life, since, whatever happens to you, hold for certain, that all will be punishment until you have pardoned, pardoned freely and for ever!”

“Yes, yes,” said Renzo, with much emotion, “I feel that I have never truly pardoned him; I have spoken as a brute and not as a Christian; and now, by the help of God, I pardon him from the bottom of my soul.”

“And should you see him?”

“I would pray God to grant me patience, and to touch his heart.”

“Do you remember that the Lord has not only told us to pardon our enemies, but to love them? Do you remember that he loved them so as to die for them?”

“Yes, I do.”

“Well, come and behold him. You have said you would find him; you shall do so; come, and you will see against whom you preserve hatred, to whom you desire evil, against what life you would arm yourself!”

He took the hand of Renzo, who followed him, without daring to ask a question. The friar led the way into one of the cabins. The first object Renzo beheld was a sick person seated on a bed of straw, who appeared to be convalescent. On seeing the father, he shook his head, as if to say No. The father bowed his with an air of sorrow and resignation. Renzo, meanwhile, gazing with uneasy curiosity around the cabin, beheld in the corner of it a sick person lying on a feather bed, wrapped up in a sheet, and covered with a cloak. Looking attentively, he recognised Don Roderick! The unfortunate man lay motionless; his eyes wide open, but without any cognisance of the objects around him; the stamp of death was on his face, which was covered with black spots; his lips were swollen and black: you would have thought it the face of the dead, if a violent contraction about the mouth had not revealed a tenacity of life; his respiration was painful, and his livid hand, extending on the outside of the covering, was firmly grasping his cloak, and pressing it upon his heart, as if conscious that there was his deepest agony.

“Behold!” said the friar, in a low solemn voice; “the sentiment you hold towards this man, who has offended you, such will God hold towards you on the great day. Bless him, and be blessed! For four days he has been here in this condition, without giving any sign of perception. Perhaps the Lord is disposed to grant him an hour of repentance, but he would have you pray for it; perhaps he desires that you should pray for him with this innocent girl; perhaps he reserves this favour for thy prayer alone, for the prayer of an afflicted and resigned heart. Perhaps the salvation of this man and thine own depend at this moment upon thyself, upon thy pity, upon thy love.” He kept silence, and clasping his hands, bowed his head as in prayer, and Renzo, completely subdued, followed his example. Their supplications were interrupted in a short time by the striking of a bell: they immediately arose and left the cabin.

“The procession is about to move,” said the father; “go then, prepared to make a sacrifice, to praise God, whatever may be the issue of your search; and whatever that may be, return to me, and we will praise him together.”

Here they separated; the one to resume his painful duties, the other to the little temple, which was close at hand.
CHAPTER XXXV.

Who would have told Renzo some moments before, that at the very time of his greatest suspense and anxiety, his heart should be divided between Lucy and Don Roderick? And nevertheless it was so. The thought of him mingled itself with all the bright or painful images which hope or fear called up as he proceeded. The words the friar had uttered by that bed of pain, blended themselves with the cruel uncertainty of his soul. He could not utter a prayer, for the happy issue of his present undertaking, without adding to it one for the miserable object of his former resentment and revenge.

He saw the Father Felix on the portico of the church, and by his attitude comprehended that the holy man was addressing the assembled convalescents. He placed himself where he could overlook the audience. In the midst were the women, covered with veils; Renzo gazed at them intently, but finding that, from the place where he stood, it would be a vain scrutiny, he directed his attention to the father. He was touched by his venerable figure; and listened with all the attention his own solicitude would allow, to the reverend speaker, who thus proceeded in his affecting address:—

“Let us think for a moment,” said he, “of the thousands who have gone forth thither,” pointing to a gate behind him, leading to the burying ground of San Gregory, which was then but one mighty grave. “Let us look at the thousands who remain here, uncertain of their destiny; let us also look at ourselves! May the Lord be praised! praised in his justice! praised in his mercy! praised in death! praised in life! praised in the choice he has made of us! Oh! why has he done it, my children, if not to preserve a people corrected by affliction, and animated by gratitude? That we may be deeply sensible that life is his gift, that we may value it accordingly, and employ it in works which he will approve? That the remembrance of our sufferings may render us compassionate, and actively benevolent to others. May those with whom we have suffered, hoped, and feared, and among whom we leave friends and kindred, may they as we pass amidst them derive edification from our deportment! May God preserve us from any exhibition of self-congratulation, or carnal joy, at escaping that death against which they are still struggling! May they see us depart, rendering thanks to Heaven for ourselves, and praying for them; that they may say, Even beyond these walls they will remember us, they will continue to pray for us! Let us begin from this moment, from the first step we shall take into the world, a life of charity! Let those who have regained their former strength, lend a fraternal arm to the feeble; let the young sustain the old; let those who are left without children become parents to the orphan, and thus your sorrows will be softened, and your lives will be acceptable to God!”

Here a deep murmur of sighs and sobs, which had been increasing in the assembly, was suddenly suspended, on seeing the friar place a cord around his neck and fall on his knees. All was intense attention and profound silence.

“For myself,” said he, “and for all my companions, who have been chosen to the high privilege of serving Christ in you, I humbly ask your forgiveness if we have not worthily fulfilled so great a ministry. If indolence, or the waywardness of the flesh, has rendered us less attentive to your wants, less prompt to your call than duty demanded; if unjust impatience, or culpable disgust, have caused us sometimes to appear severe and wearied in your presence; if, indeed, the miserable thought that you had need of us, has led us to be deficient in humility towards you; if our frailty has made us commit any action which may have given you pain, pardon us! May God remit also your offences, and bless you!”

We have here related, if not the very words, at least the sense of that which he uttered; but we cannot describe the accent which accompanied them. It was that of a man who called it a privilege to serve the afflicted, because he really considered it such; who confessed not to have worthily exercised this privilege, because he truly felt his deficiency; who asked pardon, because he was persuaded he had need of it. But his hearers, who had beheld these capuchins only occupied in serving them, who had beheld so many of them die in the service, and he who now spoke in the name of all, always the first in toil as he was the first in authority, his hearers could only answer him with tears. The good friar then took a cross which rested against a pillar, and holding it up before him, took off his sandals, passing through the crowd, which opened respectfully to give him a passage, and placed himself at their head.

Renzo, overcome with emotion, drew on one side, and placed himself near a cabin, where, half concealed, he awaited, with his eyes open, his heart palpitating, but with renewed confidence, the result of the emotion excited by the touching scene of which he had been a witness.

Father Felix proceeded barefooted at the head of the procession, with the cord about his neck, bearing that long and heavy cross; he advanced slowly but resolutely, as one who would spare the weakness of others, but whose ideas of duty enabled him to rise above his own. The largest children followed immediately behind him, for the most part barefooted, and very few entirely clothed; then came the women, nearly all of them leading a child, and singing alternately the miserere. The feeble sound of the voices, the paleness and languor of the countenances, would have excited commiseration in the heart of a mere spectator. But Renzo was occupied with his own peculiar anxieties; the slow progress of the procession enabled him to scan with ease every face as it passed. He looked and looked again, and always in vain! His eye wandered from rank to rank, from face to face—they came, they passed—in vain, in vain—none but unknown features! A new ray of hope dawned upon his mind as he beheld some cars approaching, in which were the convalescents who were still too feeble to support the fatigue of walking. They approached so slowly that Renzo had full leisure to examine each in turn. But he was again disappointed; the cars had all passed, and Father Michael, with his staff in his hand, brought up the rear as regulator of the procession.

Thus nearly vanished his hopes, and with them his resolution. His only ground of hope now was to find Lucy still under the power of the disease; to this sad and feeble hope, he clung with all the ardour of his nature. He fell on his knees at the last step of the temple, and breathed forth an unconnected, but fervent prayer; he arose, strengthened in hope; and passing the railing pointed out by the father, entered into the quarter allotted to the women. As he entered it, he saw on the ground one of the little bells that the monatti carried on their feet, with its leather straps attached to it. Thinking it might serve him as a passport, he tied it to his foot, and then began his painful search. Here new scenes of sorrow met his eye, similar in part to those he had already witnessed, partly dissimilar. Under the weight of the same calamity, he discerned a more patient endurance of pain, and a greater sensibility to the afflictions of others; they to whom bodily suffering is a lot and an inheritance, acquire from it fortitude to bear their own woes, and sympathy to bestow on the woes of others.

Renzo had proceeded some distance on his search, when he heard behind him a “Ho!” which appeared to be addressed to him. Turning, he saw at a distance a commissary, who cried, “Go there into those rooms; they want you there; they have not finished carrying all off.”

Renzo perceived that he took him for a monatto, and that the little bell had caused the mistake. He determined to extricate himself from it as soon as he could. Making a sign of obedience, he hid himself from the commissary, by passing between two cabins which were very near each other.

As he stooped to unloose the strap of the little bell, he rested his head against the straw wall of one of the cabins; a voice reached his ear. O Heaven! is it possible? His whole soul was in his ear, he scarcely breathed. Yes! yes! it was that voice! “Fear of what?” said that gentle voice; “we have passed through worse dangers than a tempest. He who has watched over us until now, will still continue to do so.”

Renzo scarcely breathed, his knees trembled, his sight became dim; with a great effort recovering his faculties, he went to the door of the cabin, and beheld her who had spoken! She was standing, leaning over a bed; she turned at the sound of his steps, and gazed for a moment bewildered; at last she exclaimed, “Oh! blessed Lord!”

“Lucy! I have found you again! I have found you again! It is, indeed, you! You live!” cried Renzo, advancing with trembling steps.

“Oh! blessed Lord!” cried Lucy, greatly agitated; “is it indeed you? How? Why? the pestilence——”

“I have had it. And you?”

“Yes. I have had it also. And my mother?”

“I have not seen her yet; she is at Pasturo. I believe, however, that she is well. But you are still suffering! how feeble you appear! you are cured, however; you are, is it not so?”

“The Lord has seen fit to leave me a little longer here below,” said Lucy. “But, Renzo! why are you here?”

“Why?” said Renzo, approaching her, “do you ask me why I am here? Must I tell you? Whom do I think of then? Am I not Renzo? Are you no longer Lucy?”

“Oh! why speak thus! Did not my mother write to you?”

“Yes! she wrote to me! kind things, truly, to write to a poor unfortunate man, an exile from his native land, one, at least, who never injured you!”

“But Renzo! Renzo! since you knew—why come, why?”

“Why come! O Lucy! why come, do you say! After so many promises! Are we no longer the same! Is all forgotten?”

“O God!” cried Lucy, sorrowfully clasping her hands, and raising her eyes to heaven; “why didst thou not take me to thyself! O Renzo! what have you done! Alas! I hoped——that with time——I should have driven from my memory——”

“A kind hope indeed! and to say so to me!”

“Oh! what have you done! in this place! in the midst of these sorrows! Here, where there is nothing but death, you have dared——”

“We must pray to God for those who die, and trust that they will be happy; but their calamity is no reason why those who live must live in despair——”

“But Renzo! Renzo! you know not what you say; a promise to the Virgin! a vow!”

“I tell you, such promises are good for nothing.”

“Oh! where have you been all this time? with whom have you associated, that you speak thus?”

“I speak as a good Christian. I think better of the Virgin than you do, because I do not believe vows to the injury of others are acceptable to her. If the Virgin had spoken herself, oh! then indeed——but it is simply an idea of your own!”

“No, no, you know not what you say; you know not what it is to make a vow! Leave me, leave me, for the love of Heaven!”

“Lucy!” said Renzo, “tell me at least, tell me, if this reason did not exist——would you feel the same towards me?”

“Unfeeling man!” said Lucy, with difficulty restraining her tears; “would it satisfy you to hear me confess that which might be sinful, and would certainly be useless! Leave me, oh! leave me! forget me! we were not destined for each other. We shall meet again above; we have not long to remain in the world. Go! tell my mother that I am cured, that even here God has assisted me, that I have found a good soul, this worthy woman who has been a mother to me; tell her we shall meet when it is the will of God, and as it is his will. Go! for the love of Heaven! and remember me no more——except when you pray to God!”

And as if wishing to withdraw from the temptation to prolong the conversation, she drew near the bed where the female was lying of whom she had spoken.

“Hear me, Lucy, hear me!” said Renzo, without however approaching her.

“No, no; go away! for charity!”

“Hear me, Father Christopher——”

“How!”

“He is here.”

“Here! where? how do you know?”

“I have just spoken with him; a man like him it appears to me——”

“He is here! to assist the afflicted, no doubt. Has he had the plague?”

“Ah! Lucy! I fear, I greatly fear——” As Renzo hesitated to utter his fears, she had unconsciously again approached him, with a look of anxious enquiry——“I fear he has it now!”

“Oh! poor man! But what do I say? poor man! he is rich, rich in the favour of God! How is he? Is he confined to his bed? Has he assistance?”

“He is, on the contrary, still assisting others——but if you were to see him! Alas! there can be no mistake!”

“Oh! is he indeed within these walls?” said Lucy.

“Here, and not far off; hardly farther than from your cottage to mine——if you remember——”

“Oh! most holy Virgin!”

“Shall I tell you what he said to me? He said I did well to come in search of you, that God would approve it, and that he would assist me to find you——Thus, then, you see——”

“If he spoke thus, it was because he did not know—”

“What use would there be in his knowing a mere imagination of your own? A man of sense, such as he is, never thinks of things of that sort. But oh! Lucy! Shall I tell you what I have seen?”——And he related his visit to the cabin.

Lucy, although familiarised in this abode of horrors to spectacles of wretchedness and despair, was shocked at the recital.

“And at the side of that bed,” said Renzo, “if you could have heard the holy man! He said, that God has perhaps resolved to look in mercy on this unfortunate—(I can now give him no other name)—that he designs to subdue him to himself, but that he desires that we should pray together for him—together! do you understand?”

“Yes, yes, we will pray each, there where the Lord shall place us. He can unite our prayers.”

“But if I tell you his very words——”

“But, Renzo, he does not know——”

“But can you not comprehend, when such a man speaks, it is God who speaks in him, and that he would not have spoken thus, if it ought not to be exactly so? And the soul of this unfortunate! I have prayed, and will pray for him; I have prayed with all my heart, as if he were my brother. But what, think you, will be his condition in the other world, if we do not repair some of the evil he has done? If you return to reason, all will be set in order. That which has been, has been—he has had his punishment here below——”

“No, Renzo, no! God would not have us do evil that good may come. Leave to him the care of this unfortunate man; our duty is to pray for him. If I had died that fatal night, would not God have been able to pardon him? And if I am not dead, if I have been delivered——”

“And your mother, poor Agnes, who desired so much to see us man and wife, has she not told you it was a foolish imagination?”.

“My mother! think you my mother would advise me to break a vow? Would you desire that she should? But, Renzo, you are not in your right mind!”

“Oh! you women cannot be made to comprehend reason! Father Christopher told me to return, and inform him whether I had found you—I will go, and get his advice——”

“Yes, yes, go to the holy man! Tell him I pray for him, and that I desire his prayers! But, for the love of Heaven! for your soul's sake, and for mine, do not return here, to trouble, to——tempt me! Father Christopher will explain matters to you, and make you return to yourself; he will set your heart at rest.”

“My heart at rest! Oh! don't encourage an idea of that sort! You have, before now, caused such language to be written to me! and the suffering it caused me! and now you have the heart to tell it to me! As for me, I declare to you plainly, that I will never set my heart at rest. Lucy! you have told me to forget you; forget you! how can I do it? After so many trials! so many promises! Who have I thought of ever since we parted? Is it because I have suffered, that you treat me thus? because I have been unfortunate? because the world has persecuted me? because I have been so long away from you? because the first moment I was able, I came to seek you?”

“Oh! holy Virgin!” exclaimed Lucy, as the tears flowed from her eyes, “come to my help. You have aided me hitherto; aid me now. Since that night such a moment as this have I never passed.”

“Yes, Lucy, you do well to invoke the Virgin. She is the mother of compassion, and will take no pleasure in our sufferings. But, if this is an excuse—if I have become odious to you—tell me, speak frankly——”

“For pity, Renzo, for pity, stop—stop. Do not make me die. Go to Father Christopher; commend me to him. Do not return here—do not return here.”

“I go, but think not I will not return. I would return from the end of the world; yes, I would return!” and he disappeared.

Lucy threw herself on the floor near the bed, upon which she rested her head, and wept bitterly. The good woman, who had been a silent spectator of the painful scene, demanded the cause of her anguish and her tears? But, perhaps, the reader will wish to know something of this benevolent person: we will satisfy the desire in a few words.

She was a rich tradeswoman, about thirty years of age: she had beheld her husband and children die of the plague. Attacked by it herself, she had been brought to the lazaretto, and placed in the cabin with Lucy, who was just beginning to recover her senses, which had forsaken her from the commencement of her attack in the house of Don Ferrante. The humble roof could only accommodate two guests, and there grew up, in their affliction, a strict and intimate friendship between them. They derived great consolation from each other's society, and had pledged themselves not to separate, after quitting the lazaretto. The good woman, whose wealth was now far more ample than were her desires, wished to retain Lucy with her as a daughter: the proposition was received with gratitude, and accepted, on condition of the permission and approval of Agnes. Lucy had, however, never made known to her the circumstances of her intended marriage, and her other extraordinary adventures; but now she related, as distinctly as tears permitted her to do so, her sad story.

Meanwhile Renzo went in search of Father Christopher: he found him with no small difficulty, and engaged in administering consolation to a dying man. The scene was soon closed. The father remained a short time in silent prayer. He then arose, and seeing Renzo approach, exclaimed, “Well, my son!”

“She is there; I have found her!”

“In what state?”

“Convalescent, and out of danger.”

“God be praised!” said the friar.

“But——” said Renzo, “there is another difficulty!”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean that——you know how good this poor girl is; but she is sometimes a little fanciful. After so many promises, she tells me now she cannot marry me, because on that night of fear she made a vow to the Virgin! These things signify nothing, do they? Is it not true that they are not binding, at least on people such as we are?”

“Is she far from this?”

“Oh no; a few steps beyond the church.”

“Wait a moment,” said the friar, “and we will go together.”

“Will you give her to understand that——?”

“I know not, my son: I must hear what she will say.” And they proceeded to Lucy's cabin.

The clouds were gathering in the heavens, and a tempest coming on. Rapid lightning, cleaving the increasing darkness, illumined at moments the long roofs and arcades of the building, and the cupola of the little church: loud claps of thunder resounded with prolonged echoes through the heavens. Renzo suppressed his impatience, and accommodated his steps to the strength of the father, who, exhausted by fatigue, oppressed by disease, and breathing in pain, could, with difficulty, drag his failing limbs to the performance of this last act of benevolence.

As they reached the door of the cabin, Renzo stopped, saying, in a trembling voice, “She is there!” They entered. Lucy arose, and ran towards the old man, crying—“Oh, what I do see! Oh, Father Christopher!”

“Well, Lucy! through how much peril has God preserved you! you must be rejoiced that you have always trusted in Him.”

“Ah! yes.—But you, my father! how you are changed! how do you feel? say, how are you?”

“As God wills, and as, through his grace, I will also,” replied the friar, with a serene countenance. Drawing her aside, he said, “Hear me, I have but a few moments to spare. Are you disposed to confide in me, as in times past?”

“Oh, are you not still my father?”

“Well, my child, what is this vow of which Renzo speaks?”

“It is a vow I made to the Virgin never to marry.”

“But did you forget that you were bound by a previous promise? God, my daughter, accepts of offerings from that which is our own. It is the heart he desires, the will; but you cannot offer the will of another to whom you had pledged yourself.”

“I have done wrong.”

“No, poor child, think not so; I believe the holy Virgin has accepted the intention of your afflicted heart, and has offered it to God for you. But tell me, did you ask the advice of any one about this matter?”

“I did not deem it a sin, or I would have confessed it, and the little good one does, one ought not to mention.”

“Have you no other motive for preventing the fulfilment of your promise to Renzo?”

“As to that——for myself——what motive?—no other,” replied Lucy, with a hesitation which implied any thing rather than uncertainty; and a blush passed over her pale and lovely countenance.

“Do you believe,” resumed the old man, “that God has given the church authority to remit the obligations that man may have contracted to him?”

“Yes, I believe it.”

“Learn, then, that the care of souls in this place, being committed to us, we have the most ample powers from the church; and I can, if you ask it, free you from the obligation you have contracted by this vow.”

“But is it not a sin to repent of a promise made to the Virgin?” said Lucy, violently agitated by unexpected hope.

“Sin, my child,” said the father, “sin, to recur to the church, and to ask her minister to use the authority which he has received from her, and which she receives from God! I bless him that he has given me, unworthy that I am, the power to speak in his name, and to restore to you your vow. If you ask me to absolve you from it, I shall not hesitate to do so; and I even hope you will.”

“Then—then—I ask it,” said Lucy, with a modest confidence.

The friar beckoned to Renzo, who was watching the progress of the dialogue with the deepest solicitude, to approach, and said aloud to Lucy, “With the authority I hold from the church, I declare you absolved from your vow, and liberate you from all the obligations you may have contracted by it.”

The reader may imagine the feelings of Renzo at these words. His eyes expressed the warmth of his gratitude to him who had uttered them; but they sought in vain for Lucy's.

“Return in peace and safety to your former attachment,” said the father. “And do you remember, my son, that in giving you this companion, the church does it not to insure simply your temporal happiness, but to prepare you both for happiness without end. Thank Heaven that you have been brought to this state through misery and affliction: your joy will be the more temperate and durable. If God should grant you children, bring them up in his fear, and in love to all men—for the rest you cannot greatly err. And now, Lucy, has Renzo told you whom he has beheld in this place?”

“Yes, father, he has told me.”

“You will pray for him, and for me also, my children. You will remember your poor friar?” And drawing from his basket a small wooden box, “Within this box are the remains of the loaf—the first I asked for charity—the loaf of which you have heard; I leave it to you; show it to your children; they will come into a wicked world; they will meet the proud and insolent. Tell them always to forgive, always! every thing, every thing! And let them pray for the poor friar!”

Lucy took the box from his hands with reverence, and he continued, “Now tell me what you mean to do here at Milan? and who will conduct you to your mother?”

“This good lady has been a mother to me,” said Lucy; “we shall leave this place together, and she will provide for all.”

“May God bless her!” said the friar, approaching the bed.

“May he bestow his blessing upon you!” said the widow, “for the joy you have given to the afflicted, although it disappoints my hope of having Lucy as a companion. But I will accompany her to her village, and restore her to her mother, and,” added she, in a low voice, “I will give the outfit. I have much wealth, and of those who should have enjoyed it with me none are left.”

“The service will be acceptable to God,” said the father, “who has watched over you both in affliction. Now,” added he, turning to Renzo, “we must begone; I have remained too long already.”

“Oh, my father,” said Lucy, “shall I see you again? I have recovered from this dreadful disease, I who am of no use in the world; and you——”

“It is long since,” replied the old man with a serious and gentle tone, “I asked a great favour from Heaven; that of ending my days in the service of my fellow-men. If God grants it to me now, all those who love me should help me to return him thanks. And now give Renzo your commissions for your mother.”

“Tell her all,” said Lucy to her betrothed; “tell her I have found here another mother, and that we will come to her as soon as we possibly can.”

“If you have need of money,” said Renzo, “I have here all that you sent——”

“No, no,” said the widow, “I have more than sufficient.”

“Farewell, Lucy, and you, too, good signora, till we meet again,” said Renzo, not having words to express his feelings at this moment.

“Who knows whether we shall all meet again?” cried Lucy.

“May God ever watch over you and bless you!” said the friar, as he quitted the cabin with Renzo.

As night was not far distant, the capuchin offered the young man a shelter in his humble abode: “I cannot bear you company,” said he, “but you can at least repose yourself, in order to be able to prosecute your journey.”

Renzo, however, felt impatient to be gone; as to the hour or the weather it might be said that, night or day, rain or shine, heat or cold, were equally indifferent to him; the friar pressed his hand as he departed, saying, “If you find, which may God grant! the good Agnes, remember me to her; tell her, as well as all those who remember Friar Christopher, to pray for me.”

“Oh, dear father, shall we never meet again?”

“Above, I hope. Farewell, farewell!”
CHAPTER XXXVI.

As Renzo passed without the walls of the lazaretto, the rain began to fall in torrents. Instead of lamenting, he rejoiced at it: he was delighted with the refreshing air, and with the sound of the falling drops from the plants and foliage which seemed to have new life imparted to them; and breathing more freely in this change of nature, he felt more vividly the change that had occurred in his own destiny.

But much would his enjoyment have been increased, could he have surmised what would be seen a few days after. This water carried off, washed away, so to speak, the contagion. If the lazaretto did not restore to the living all the living it still contained, at least from that day it received no more into its vast abyss. At the end of a week, shops were opened, people returned to their houses, quarantine was hardly spoken of, and there remained of the pestilence but a few scattered traces.

Our traveller proceeded on full of joy, without having thought where or when he should stop for the night; anxious only to go forward to reach the village, and to proceed immediately to Pasturo in search of Agnes. In the midst of the reminiscences of the horrors and the dangers of the day, there was always present the thought, “I have found her! she is well! she is mine!”

And then again he recalled his doubts, his difficulties, his fears, his hopes, that had agitated him that eventful morning! He fancied himself with his hand on the knocker of Don Ferrante's house! And the unfavourable answer! And then those fools who were about to attack him in their madness! And the lazaretto, that vast sepulchre! To have hurried thither to find her, and to have found her! And the procession! What a moment! And now it appeared nothing to him! And the quarter set apart for the women! And there, behind that cabin when he least expected it, that voice! that voice itself! And to see her there! But then her vow! It exists no longer. And his violent hatred against Don Roderick, which had augmented his grief, and shed its venom over his hopes! That also was gone. Indeed, had it not been for his uncertainty concerning Agnes, his anxiety about Father Christopher, and the consciousness that the pestilence still existed, his happiness would have been without alloy.

He arrived at Sesto in the evening; the rain had as yet no appearance of ceasing. But Renzo did not stop, his only inconvenience was an extraordinary appetite, which the vicinity of a baker's shop enabled him to mitigate the violence of. When he passed through Monza it was dark night; he succeeded, however, in leaving it by the right road; but what a road! buried between two banks, almost like the bed of a river, it might then, indeed, have been called a river, or rather, an aqueduct; in numerous places were deep holes, from which Renzo could with difficulty extricate himself. But he did as well as he could, without impatience or regret. He reflected that every step brought him nearer to the end of his journey; that the rain would cease when God should please; that day would come in its own time; and that in the mean time the road he had passed over he should not have to travel again. At the break of day he found himself near the Adda. It had not ceased raining; there was still a drizzling shower; the light of the dawn enabled Renzo to see around him. He was in his own country! Who can express his sensations? Those mountains, the Resegone, the territory of Lecco, appeared to belong to him, to be his own! But, looking at himself, he felt that his outward aspect was rather at variance with the exuberant joyousness of his heart; his clothes were wet and clinging to his body, his hat bent out of shape and full of water; his hair hanging straight about his face; while his lower man was encased in a dense covering of mud.

He reached Pescate; travelled along the Adda, giving a melancholy glance at Pescarenico; passed the bridge, and crossed the fields, to the house of his friend, who, just risen, was at the door, looking out upon the weather. He beheld the strange figure, covered with mud, and wet to the skin, and yet, so joyous and animated! in his life he had never seen a man, so accoutred, appear so satisfied with himself.

“How!” said he, “already here! and in such weather! How have things gone with you?”

“She is there! she is there! she is there!”

“Well and safe?”

“Convalescent, which is better! I have wonderful things to tell you.”

“But what a state you are in!”

“A pretty pickle indeed!”

“In truth you might squeeze water enough from your upper half to wash away the mud from the lower. But wait a moment; I will make a fire.”

“I shall be glad to feel its warmth, I assure you. Do you know where the rain overtook me? Precisely at the door of the lazaretto; but no matter, the weather does its business, and I mine.”

His friend soon kindled a bright blaze. “Now do me another favour,” said Renzo, “bring me the bundle I left above; for before my clothes dry——”

Returning with the bundle, his friend said, “You must be hungry; you have had drink enough, no doubt, on the way, but as to eating——”

“I bought two loaves yesterday at dusk, but truly, I have not eaten them.”

“Well, I will provide for you.” He poured some water in a kettle which hung over the fire, adding, “I will go and milk the cow, and when I return with the milk, the water will be ready, and we will have a good polenta. You, in the mean while, change your clothes.” After having allowed him time to perform the troublesome operation, his friend returned, and commenced making the polenta. “I have much to tell you,” said Renzo. “If you were to see Milan! and the lazaretto! She is there! you will soon see her here; she will be my wife; you shall be at the wedding, and, pestilence or not, we will be happy for a few hours.”

On the following morning Renzo set out for Pasturo. On his arrival, he asked concerning Agnes, and learnt that she was in health and safety. He approached her residence, which had been pointed out to him, and called her by name from the street. At the sound of his voice, she rushed to the window, and Renzo, without allowing her time to speak, cried, “Lucy is well; I saw her the day before yesterday; she will be at home shortly; oh, I have so many things to tell you.”

Overcome by various emotions, Agnes could only articulate, “I will open the door for you.”

“Stop, stop,” said Renzo. “You have not had the plague, I believe?”

“No. Have you?”

“Yes; but you ought to be prudent. I come from Milan; and have been for two days in the midst of it. It is true I have changed my clothes, but the contagion attaches itself to the flesh, like witchcraft; and since God has preserved you until now, you must take care of yourself until all danger is over; for you are our mother, and I trust we shall live long together as a compensation for the sufferings we have endured, I at least.”

“But——”

“There is no longer any but; I know what you would say. You will soon see there is no longer any but; come into the open air, where I may speak to you in safety, and I will tell you all about it.”

Agnes pointed to a garden adjoining the house. Renzo entered it, and was immediately joined by the anxious and impatient Agnes. They seated themselves opposite each other on two benches. The events he described are already known to our reader, and we will leave to his imagination the numerous exclamations of grief, horror, surprise, and joy, that interrupted the progress of the narrative every moment. The result, however, was an agreement to settle all together at Bergamo, where Renzo had already an advantageous engagement; when would depend on the pestilence and other circumstances; Agnes was to remain where she was, until it should be safe for her to return home; and in the interval she should have regular information of all their movements.

He departed, with the additional consolation of having found one so dear to him safe and well. He remained the rest of that day and the following night with his friend, and on the morrow set out for the country of his adoption.

He found Bortolo in good health, and in less apprehension of losing it, as within a few days things had rapidly changed for the better. The malignity of the distemper had subsided, and given place to fever indeed, accompanied with tumours, but much more easily cured. The country presented a new aspect; those who had survived the pestilence began to resume their business; masters were preparing for the employment of workmen in every trade; and, above all, in that of weaving silk. Renzo made some preparations for the accommodation of his family, by purchasing and furnishing a neat little cottage, from his hitherto untouched treasure, which the ravages of the plague enabled him to do at small cost.

After a few days' stay, he returned by the way of Pasturo, and conducted Agnes to her village home: we will not attempt to describe her feelings at beholding again those well remembered places. She found all things in her cottage as she had left them: it seemed as if angels had watched over the poor widow and her child. Her first care was to get ready with all speed an apartment in her humble abode for that kind friend who had been to her child a second mother. Renzo, on his side, was not idle. He laboured alternately at the widow's garden, and in the service of his hospitable friend. As to his own cottage, it pained him to witness the scene of desolation it presented; and he resolved to dispose of it, and transfer its value to his new country. His re-appearance in the village was a cause of much congratulation to those who had survived the plague. All were anxious to learn his adventures, which had given rise to so many reports among the neighbours. As to Don Abbondio, he exhibited the same apprehension of the marriage as before; the mention of which conjured up to his affrighted fancy the dreaded Don Roderick and his train on the one side, and the almost equally feared cardinal and his arguments on the other.

We will now transport the reader for a few moments to Milan. Some days after the visit of Renzo to the lazaretto, Lucy left it with the good widow. A general quarantine having been ordered, they passed the period of it together in the house of the latter. The time was employed in preparing Lucy's wedding clothes; and, the quarantine terminated, they set off on their journey. We could add, they arrived, but, notwithstanding our desire to yield to the impatience of the reader, there are three circumstances which we must not pass over in silence.

The first is, that while Lucy was relating her adventures more minutely to the good widow, she recurred to the signora, who had afforded her an asylum, in the convent of Monza, and in return learnt many things which afforded her the solution to numerous mysteries, and filled her with sorrow and astonishment. She learnt, too, that the unfortunate signora, falling afterwards under the most horrible suspicions, had been, by order of the cardinal, transferred to a convent at Milan; that there, after having given herself up for a time to rage and despair, she had at last made her confession and repented of her crimes; and that her present life was one of severe and voluntary penance. If any one desires to know the details of her sad history, it will be found in the author we have so often quoted.[36]

The second is, that Lucy, making enquiries concerning Father Christopher, of every capuchin from the lazaretto, learnt with more grief than surprise that he had died of the pestilence.

And the third is, that before quitting Milan, Lucy had a desire to know something concerning her former patrons. The widow accompanied her to their house, where they were informed that both had died of the plague. When we say of Donna Prassede she died, we have said all that is necessary; not so with Don Ferrante, he deserves a little more of our attention, considering his learning.

From the commencement of the pestilence, Don Ferrante was one of the most resolute in denying its existence, not indeed like the multitude, with cries of rage, but with arguments which none could accuse of want of concatenation. “In rerum natura,” said he, “there are but two kinds of things, substances and accidents; and if I prove that the contagion can neither be one nor the other of these I shall have proved that it does not exist; that it is a chimera. Thus, then: substances are either material or spiritual; that the contagion is a spiritual substance, is so absurd an opinion, that no one would presume to advance it; it is, then, useless to speak of it. Material substances are either simple or compound. Now, the contagion is not a simple substance, and I will prove it in three words. It is not an aerial substance, because, if it were, instead of passing from one body to another, it would fly off to its sphere; it is not a watery substance, because it would be dried up by the wind; it is not igneous, because it would burn; it is not earthy, because it would be visible. Moreover, it is not a compound substance, because it would be sensible to the eye, or to the touch; and who has seen it? or touched it? It remains to see if it be an accident. This is still less probable. The doctors say it is communicated from body to body; this is their Achilles; the pretext for so many useless regulations. Now, supposing it an accident, it would be a transferable accident, which is an incongruity. There is not in all philosophy a more evident thing than this, that an accident cannot pass from one subject to another; so if, to avoid this Scylla, they are reduced to call it an accident produced, they avoid Scylla by falling into Charybdis, because if it be produced, it does not communicate itself, it does not propagate, as they declare. These principles allowed, what is the use of talking of botches and carbuncles?”

“It is folly,” said one of his hearers.

“No, no,” resumed Don Ferrante, “I do not say so. Science is science; we must only know how to employ it. Swellings, purple botches, and black carbuncles, are respectable terms, which have a good and proper signification; but I say they have nothing to do with the question. Who denies that there may be and are such things? We must only prove whence they come.”

Here began the vexations of Don Ferrante. So long as he laughed at the contagion, he found respectful and attentive listeners; but when he came to distinguish and demonstrate that the error of the doctors was, not in affirming that there existed a general and terrible disease, but rather in assigning its cause, then he found them intractable and rebellious, then he no longer dared expose his doctrine, but by shreds and patches.

“Here is the true reason,” said he, “and those even who maintain other fancies are obliged to acknowledge it. Let them deny, if they can, that there is a fatal conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. And when has it been said that influences propagate? And would these gentlemen deny the existence of influences? Will they say there are no planets? or will they say that they keep up above, doing nothing, as so many pins in a pincushion? But that which I cannot understand from these doctors is, that they confess we are under so malign a conjunction, and then they tell us, don't touch this, don't touch that, and you will be safe! as if, in avoiding the material contact of terrestrial bodies, we could prevent the virtual effect of celestial bodies. And such a work in burning rags! Poor people! will you burn Jupiter? will you burn Saturn?”

His fretus, that is to say, on these grounds, he took no precautions against the pestilence; he caught it, and died, like Metastasio's hero, complaining of the stars.
CHAPTER XXXVII.

One fine evening Agnes heard a carriage drive up to the door of her cottage. It was Lucy and the good widow. We can easily imagine the joy of the meeting.

The following morning Renzo made his appearance, at an early hour, little expecting to find Lucy with her mother. “How are you, Renzo?” said Lucy, with downcast eyes, and in a tone—oh how different from that with which she addressed all besides! Renzo was conscious that it was meant for him alone.

“I am always well when I see you,” replied the young man.

“Our poor Father Christopher,” said Lucy, “pray for his soul, although we may be almost sure he is now in heaven, praying for us.”

“I expected no less,” said Renzo mournfully, “I expected to hear that he was taken away from this world of sorrow and trouble.”

Notwithstanding the sadness of their recollections, joy was the predominant feeling of their hearts. The good widow was an agreeable addition to the little company. When Renzo saw her in the miserable cabin at the lazaretto, he could not have believed her to be of so facile and gay a disposition; but the lazaretto and the country, death and a wedding, are not at all the same things. During the evening Renzo left them, for the purpose of visiting the curate. “Signor Curate,” said he, with a respectful but jocular air, “the headache, which, you said, prevented you from marrying us, has it passed off? The bride is here, and I am come to have you appoint an hour, but, I pray you, not to let it be far distant.”

Don Abbondio did not say he would not; but he began to offer excuses and insinuations. “Why come forward into public view with this order for his apprehension hanging over him? and the thing could be easily done elsewhere, and then this, and then that.”

“I understand,” said Renzo, “you have still a little pain in your head, but listen to me.” And he described the state in which he had seen Don Roderick.

“That has nothing to do with us,” said Don Abbondio. “Did I say no to you? However, while there is life there is hope, you know. Look at me; I have also been nearer the other world than this, and here I am nevertheless; and if new troubles do not fall upon me, I hope to remain here a little longer.”

The conversation was prolonged some time, without coming to any satisfactory conclusion, and Renzo returned home to relate it. “I came off,” said he, “because I feared I should lose all patience. At times he behaved exactly as he did before, and I verily believe if I had remained a little longer, he would have spoken Latin again. I see that all this portends a tedious business. It would be better to do as he says, and go and be married where we intend to live.”

“Let us go and see what we can do,” said the widow, “perhaps he will be more tractable to the ladies.”

They followed this advice, and in the afternoon proceeded to the parsonage. The curate evinced much pleasure on seeing Lucy and Agnes, and much politeness towards the stranger. He endeavoured to divert the discourse from that which he knew to be the purport of their visit. He begged from Lucy a recital of all her woes, and availed himself of the account of the lazaretto to draw the stranger into the conversation. He then expatiated on his own miseries, which he detailed at full length. The pause so long watched for came at last. One of the widows broke the ice; but Don Abbondio was no longer the same man; he did not say no; but he returned to his doubts and his difficulties, jumping like a bird from branch to branch. “It would be necessary,” said he, “to get free from this unlucky order. You, signora, who live at Milan, you ought to know the course of these things; if we had the protection of some powerful man, all wounds would be healed. After all, the shortest way would be to have the ceremony performed where these young people are going, and where this proscription cannot affect them. Here, with this order, which is known to every one, to utter from the altar the name of Lorenzo Tramaglino is a thing I should be very unwilling to do. I wish him too well; it would be rendering him an ill service.”

While Agnes and the widow were endeavouring to reply to these reasons, which the subtle curate as often reproduced under another form, Renzo entered the room, with the air of one bringing important intelligence, “The Lord Marquis *** has arrived!” said he.

“What do you mean? arrived! where?” said Don Abbondio, rising.

“He has arrived at his castle, which was Don Roderick's: he is the heir by feoffment of trust, as they say. So that there is no longer a doubt on the subject. And as to the marquis, he is a most worthy man.”

“That he is,” said Don Abbondio; “I have often heard him spoken of as an excellent lord. But is it really true that——”

“Will you believe your sexton?”

“Why——”

“Because he saw him with his own eyes. Will you hear Ambrose? I made him wait without expressly.”

Renzo called the sexton, who confirmed the intelligence.

“Ah, he is dead then! he is really gone!” said Don Abbondio. “You see, my children, the hand of Providence. It is a happy thing for this poor country: we could not live with this man. The plague has been a great scourge, but it has also been, as it were, a serviceable broom; it has swept off certain people, of whom, my children, we could never have delivered ourselves. In the twinkling of an eye they have disappeared by the hundred. We shall no longer see him wandering about with that haughty air, followed by his cut throats, and looking at every body as if they were all placed on earth for his pleasure. He is gone, and we are still here! He will send no more messages to honest people. He has made us all pass a sad life; and now we are at liberty to say so.”

“I pardon him,” said Renzo, “with all my heart.”

“And you do well; it is your duty; but we may also thank Heaven for delivering us from him. Now, if you wish to be married, I am ready. As to the order for your seizure, that is of little importance; the plague has carried off that too. If you choose—to-day is Thursday—on Sunday, I will publish the banns, and then I shall have the happiness of uniting you.”

“You know we came for that purpose,” said Renzo.

“Very well; and I will send word of it to his Eminence.”

“Who is his Eminence?” asked Agnes.

“His Eminence? our lord cardinal archbishop, whom may God preserve!”

“Oh, as to that, you are mistaken; I can tell you they do not call him so, because the second time we went to speak with him, one of the priests drew me aside, and told me I must call him your illustrious lordship, and my lord.”

“And now, if that same priest were to tell you, he would say you must call him Your Eminence; the pope has ordered, that this title be given to the cardinals. And do you know why? Because Most Illustrious was assumed by so many people who had no right to it. By and by, they will call the bishops Your Eminence, then the abbots will claim it, then the canons——”

“And the curates,” said the widow.

“No, no, let the curates alone for that; they will be only Your Reverence to the end of the world. But to return to our affairs. On Sunday, I will publish the banns at the church, and obtain, in the mean time, a dispensation for omitting the two other publications. There will be plenty of similar applications, if things go on elsewhere as they do here; the fire has taken; no one will wish to live alone, I imagine; I have already three marriages on hand besides yours; what a pity Perpetua is dead, she might find a husband! And at Milan, signora, I imagine it is the same thing.”

“Yes, indeed. In my parish alone there were fifty marriages last Sunday.”

“Well, the world wo'n't end yet. And you, signora, has no butterfly begun to fly around you?”

“No, no, I think not of it; I do not mean to think of it.”

“Oh, yes, yes; would you be alone indeed? Agnes also, Agnes also——”

“You have a mind to jest,” said Agnes.

“To be sure I have; it is high time. We may hope that the few days that remain to us will be less sad. As for me, poor old man! there is no remedy for years, as they say, Senectus ipsa est morbus.”

“Oh, now,” said Renzo, “you may speak Latin as much as you like; I don't care about it now.”

“You still quarrel with Latin, do you? Well, I will not forget you. When you come before me with Lucy, to pronounce some little words in Latin, I will say to you, You do not like Latin, go in peace. Eh?”

“Ah, it is not that Latin I dislike, pure and holy like that of the mass; I speak of the Latin which falls on one as a traitor, in the very midst of conversation. For example, now that we are here, and all is past, the Latin you spoke there, in that corner, to make me understand that you could not, and——I know not what. Tell me now in language I can understand, will you?”

“Hush! you mischievous fellow, hush!” said Don Abbondio. “Do not stir up old grievances: if we were to settle our accounts, I do not know which of us would be in debt to the other. I have forgiven you, but you also played me an ill turn. As for you, it did not astonish me, because you are a good-for-nothing fellow; but I speak of this silent—this little saint; one would have thought it a sin to distrust her. But I know who advised her; I know I do,” added he, pointing to Agnes.

It is impossible to describe the change which had come over him. His mind, so long the slave of continual apprehension, was now emancipated from its fetters, and his tongue, liberated from its bonds, recurred to its former habits. He playfully prolonged the conversation, even following them to the door, with some parting jest.

The following morning, Don Abbondio received a visit, as agreeable as it was unexpected, from the lord marquis, whose appearance confirmed all that report had said of him. “I come,” said he, “to bring you the salutations of the cardinal archbishop.”

“Oh, what condescension in both of you!”

“When I took leave of that incomparable man, who honours me with his friendship, he spoke to me of two young people of this parish who have suffered much from the unfortunate Don Roderick. My lord wishes to hear of them. Are they living? Are their affairs settled?”

“Their affairs are settled; and I had thought of writing to his Eminence about it, but now that I have the honour——”

“Are they here?”

“Yes; and as soon as possible, they will be man and wife.”

“I request you to tell me what I can do for them, and the best manner of doing it. You will render me a service by enabling me to dispose of some of my superfluous wealth for their benefit.”

“May Heaven reward you! I thank you in the name of my children,” said Don Abbondio; “and since your lordship allows me, I have an expedient to suggest which perhaps will not displease you. These good people have resolved to establish themselves elsewhere, and to sell the little that belongs to them here. The best charity you can render them, is to buy their property, as otherwise it will be sold for little or nothing. But your lordship will decide, I have spoken in obedience to your commands.”

The marquis thanked Don Abbondio, telling him he should leave it to him to fix the price, and to do so entirely to their advantage, as it was an object with him to make the amount as large as possible. He then proposed that they should go together to the cottage of Lucy.

On their way, Don Abbondio, quite overjoyed continued the conversation,—“Since your lordship is so disposed to benefit this people, there is another service you can render them. The young man has an order for his apprehension out against him, for some folly he committed two years ago at Milan, on the day of the great Tumult. A recommendation, a word, from a man like yourself, might hereafter be of service to him.”

“Are there not heavy charges against him?”

“They made a great deal of noise about it; but really there was nothing in it.”

“Well, well; I will take it upon myself to free him from all embarrassment.”

We may imagine the surprise of our little company, at a visit from such a guest. He entered agreeably into conversation with them and after a while, made his proposal. Don Abbondio, being requested by him to fix the price, did so; the purchaser said he was well satisfied, and, if he had not understood him, in repeating it, doubled the sum. He would not hear of rectifying the mistake, and ended the conversation by inviting the company to dinner the day after the wedding, when the affair could be settled with every necessary formality.

“Ah!” thought Don Abbondio when he returned home, “if the pestilence acted everywhere with so much discrimination, it would be a pity to speak ill of it. We should want one every generation.”

The happy day at length arrived. The betrothed went to the church where they were united by Don Abbondio. The day after, the wedding party made their visit at the castle. We will leave the reader to imagine their reflections on entering those walls! In the midst of their joy, however, they felt that the presence of the good Father Christopher was wanting to complete it. “But,” said Lucy, “he is even happier than we are, assuredly.”

The contract was drawn up by a doctor, but not Azzecca Garbugli! He was gone to Canterelli. For those who are not of this country, an explanation of this expression may be necessary.

About half a mile above Lecco, and nearly on the borders of the other territory, called Castello, is Canterelli. This was a spot where two roads cross. Near the point of junction there is a small eminence, an artificial hill, surmounted by a cross. This was a heap of bodies, dead of this epidemic. It is true, tradition simply says, the dead of the epidemic; but it must have been this one, as it was the last, and most severe within the memory of man: and we know that tradition says very little of itself, unless we render it some assistance.

On their return, no other inconvenience was felt, than the weight of the money which Renzo had to sustain. However, he did not look upon this as one of the greatest hardships he had had to encounter. There was, however, one matter which perplexed him not a little. How should he employ it? Should it be in agriculture? Should it be in business? Or why choose at all? Were not both in turn, like one's legs, better than either singly?

It will be asked, Did they feel no regrets on quitting their native village—their native mountains? Don Roderick and his wretched agents could no longer disturb them. Regrets they did feel; but the old recollections of happiness enjoyed amidst its scenes, had been greatly weakened by recent distresses and apprehensions, and new hopes had arisen connected with their new country; so that they could look to their change of abode without any feelings of grief.

The little company now thought only of preparing for their journey,—the Tramaglino family to their new country, and the widow to Milan. Many tears were shed, many thanks given, and many promises to meet again. The separation of Renzo and the friend who had treated him so hospitably, was not less tender. Neither did they part coldly from Don Abbondio: they had always preserved a certain respect for their curate, and he, in his heart, had always wished them well. It is these unfortunate affairs of the world which perplex our affections. But who would believe that, in this new abode, where Renzo had expected such happiness, he should find only vexation! This was the result of trifles, doubtless; but it requires so little to disturb a state of happiness in this life!

The reports the Bergamascans had heard of Lucy, together with Renzo's extraordinary attachment to her—perhaps, too, the representations of some partial friend—had contributed to excite an extravagant idea of her beauty. When Lucy appeared, they began to shrug their shoulders, and say, “Is this the woman? We expected something very different! What is she, after all? A peasant, like a thousand others! Women like her, and fairer than she, are to be found every where!”

Unfortunately, some kind friends told Renzo these things, perhaps added to what they had heard, and roused his indignation. “And what consequence is it to you?” said he. “Who told you what to expect? Did I ever do so? Did I tell you she was beautiful? She is a peasant, forsooth! Did I ever say I would bring a princess here? She does not please you. Do not look at her, then: you have beautiful women; look at them.” Thus did he make himself unhappy; and believing that all were disposed to criticise his Lucy, he showed ill nature in return. It would have gone ill with him, if he had been condemned to remain in the place; but fortune smiled on him in this respect.

The master of another manufactory, situated near the gates of Bergamo, being dead, the inheritor of it, a young libertine, was willing to sell it half price, for ready money. Bortolo proposed to his cousin that they should make the purchase together. They did so; and when they entered into possession, Lucy was much pleased, and Renzo also, and not the less so for having heard that more than one person amongst his neighbours had said, “Have you seen this beautiful simpleton who is just come?”

Their affairs now went on prosperously. Before the year was completed, a beautiful little creature made her appearance, as if to give them the earliest opportunity of fulfilling Lucy's vow. Be assured it was named Maria. In the course of time, they were surrounded by others of both sexes, whom Agnes was delighted to carry about one after the other, calling them little rogues, and loading them with kisses. They were all taught to read and write; “for,” said Renzo, “as this notion is in the country, we may as well take advantage of it.”

It was highly pleasing to hear him relate his adventures: he always concluded by naming the great things he had learnt, by which to govern his conduct for the future. “I have learnt,” said he, “not to mix in quarrels; not to preach in public; not to drink more than I want; not to keep my hand on the knocker of a door, when the inhabitants of the place are all crazy; not to tie a little bell to my feet, before I think of the consequences.”

“And I!” said Lucy, who thought that the doctrine of her moralist, though sound, was rather confused, and certainly incomplete—“what have I learnt?” said she. “I have not sought misfortunes, they have sought me. Unless you say,” smiling affectionately, “that my error was in loving you, and promising myself to you.”

They settled the question, by deciding that misfortunes most commonly happen to us from our own misconduct or imprudence; but sometimes from causes independent of ourselves; that the most innocent and prudent conduct cannot always preserve us from them; and that, whether they arise from our own fault or not, trust in God softens them, and renders them useful in preparing us for a better life. Although this was said by poor peasants, it appears to us so just, that we offer it here as the moral of our story.

THE END.
